\section*{Chapter 11: Coordinate Geometry}

The portion of geometry where the algebraic expressions of points, straight lines and curved lines are studied is known as the Coordinate Geometry. This portion of geometry is also known as the Analytic Geometry. With the plotting of points on the plane, the straight lines or the curved lines or the figures of the geometric regions made by them such as the triangles, the quadrilaterals, the circles etc. are expressed. The system of plotting of points on the plane was initiated by a French mathematician named Rene Descartes (known as Descartes). The coordinate system of geometry initiated by Descartes is called the Cartesian coordinate system after his name. The coordinate geometry and the analytical geometry are mainly based on Cartesian coordinate system. So, Descartes is called the initiator of the analytical geometry.

In the first part of this chapter, the tricks of determining the distance between two points will be discussed through developing the concept of the Cartesian coordinate system among the students. In the second part, the method of determining the area of any triangle and quadrilateral created by straight lines will be discussed. On the other hand, in the third part, the tricks of determining the slope of a straight line and the simplification of the joining straight line between the two points will be explained. No figure or equation associated with the curved line will be discussed here. In higher classes, it will be discussed elaborately.

After completing this chapter, the students will be able to

\begin{itemize}
    \item explain the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system;
    \item find the distance between two points;
    \item explain the concept of slope (gradient) of a straight line;
    \item find the equation of a straight line;
    \item determine the area of a triangle using coordinate system;
    \item find areas of triangular and quadrangular regions by measuring the lengths of the sides;
    \item construct the geometric figures of the triangles and quadrilaterals by plotting of points;
    \item present an equation of a straight line by plotting points.
\end{itemize}

\part{Rectangular Cartesian Coordinates}
\section*{Rectangular Cartesian Coordinates}

We have been acquainted with the concept of plane in previous class. The surface of a table, the floor of a room, the surface of a book, even the paper on which we write down, each of them is a plane. The surface of a football or the surface of a bottle are curved planes. In this part, the tricks of determining the proper position of any point lying on the plane will be discussed. For determining the proper position of any definite point, it is necessary to know the distance of the definite point from the straight line bisectors constructed on the plane. It is said as a reason that only a point can lie at any definite distance from two straight line bisectors.

If two such straight lines $XOX'$ and $YOY'$ are drawn that intersect each other at a right angle on any plane, $XOX'$ is called the $x$-axis, $YOY'$ is called the $y$-axis and the intersecting point '$O$' is called the origin.

Now, let $P$ be any point on the plane of the two axis. From point $P$, on $XOX'$ i.e., the $x$-axis and on $YOY'$ i.e., the $y$-axis, the perpendiculars are respectively $PM$ and $PN$. Then the distance of point $P$ from the $y$-axis $=NP=OM=x$ is called the abscissa of $P$ or $x$-coordinate. Again, the distance of $P$ from the $x$-axis $==MP=ON=y$ is called the ordinate of $P$ or $y$-coordinate. The abscissa and the Ordinate are jointly called the Coordinate. So, in the figure, the coordinate of $P$ means the perpendicular distance of $P$ from the $y$-axis and the $x$-axis and by denoting them as $x$ and $y$, the coordinate of $P$ is expressed by the symbol $P(x, y)$.

Image description: A diagram showing the Cartesian coordinate system with $x$-axis ($XOX'$) and $y$-axis ($YOY'$) intersecting at the origin $O$. A point $P(x, y)$ is plotted on the plane, with perpendiculars $PM$ to the $x$-axis and $PN$ to the $y$-axis, illustrating the abscissa ($x$) and ordinate ($y$).

The coordinate index $(x, y)$ means an ordered pair whose first element indicates the abscissa and the second element indicates the ordinate. So, if $x \neq y$, by $(x, y)$ and $(y, x)$, two different points are meant. Therefore, the coordinate of any point depending on two axis intersecting each other at the right angle is called the Rectangular Cartesian Coordinates. If the point is placed at the right side of the $y$-axis, the abscissa will be positive and if it is placed at the left side, the abscissa will be negative. Again, if the point is placed above the $x$-axis, the ordinate will be positive and if it is placed below, the ordinate will be negative. On the $x$-axis, the ordinate will be zero and on $y$-axis, the abscissa will be zero.

So, the positive abscissa and the ordinate of any point will be along $OX$ and $OY$ respectively or parallel to them. Similarly, the negative abscissa or the ordinate will be along $OX'$ and $OY'$ respectively or parallel to them. By the two axis of the Cartesian coordinates, the plane is divided into $XOY, YOX', X'OY', Y'OX$ these four parts. Each of them is called a quadrant. The quadrant $XOY$ is taken as the first and by turns the second, the third and the fourth quadrant remain in anti-clockwise order. According to the sign of the point of the coordinate, the point lies on the different quadrants.

\section*{Distance between two points}

Let, $P\left(x_1, y_1\right)$ and $Q\left(x_2, y_2\right)$ be the two different points on a plane. From points $P$ and $Q$, perpendiculars $PM$ and $QN$ are drawn on $x$-axis. Again from point $P$, draw perpendicular $PR$ on $QN$.

Now the abscissa of point $P$ is $=OM=x_1$ and the ordinate of point $P$ is $=MP=y_1$. The abscissa of point $Q$ is $=ON=x_2$ and the ordinate $NQ$ is $=y_2$. From the figure we get,

\[
PR = MN = ON - OM = x_2 - x_1
\]

\[
QR = NQ - NR = NQ - MP = y_2 - y_1
\]

As per the construction, $PQR$ is a right angled triangle and $PQ$ is the hypotenuse of the triangle. So, as per the theorem of Pythagoras,

\[
\begin{aligned}
& PQ^2 = PR^2 + QR^2 \\
& \text{or, } PQ = \pm \sqrt{PR^2 + QR^2} \\
& \text{or, } PQ = \pm \sqrt{\left(x_2 - x_1\right)^2 + \left(y_2 - y_1\right)^2}
\end{aligned}
\]

$\therefore$ The distance of $P$ from $Q$ is, $PQ = \sqrt{\left(x_2 - x_1\right)^2 + \left(y_2 - y_1\right)^2}$

As the distance is always non-negative, the negative value has been avoided.

Again, in the same rule the distance from point $Q$ to $P$ is,

\[
QP = \sqrt{\left(x_1 - x_2\right)^2 + \left(y_1 - y_2\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(x_2 - x_1\right)^2 + \left(y_2 - y_1\right)^2}
\]

$\therefore PQ = QP$.

The distance from point $P$ to $Q$ or $Q$ to $P$ is equal.

Therefore, $PQ = \sqrt{\left(x_2 - x_1\right)^2 + \left(y_2 - y_1\right)^2} = QP$

\textbf{Corollary 1.} The distance of any point $P(x, y)$ lying on the plane from the origin $(0,0)$ is

\[
PQ = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

\textbf{Example 1.} Plot the two points $(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$ on a plane. Find the distance between them.

Solution: Let $P(1,1)$ and $Q(2,2)$ be the given two points. In the figure, the two points have been plotted on the plane $xy$. The distance between the two points is

\[
\begin{aligned}
& PQ = \sqrt{\left(x_2 - x_1\right)^2 + \left(y_2 - y_1\right)^2} \\
& = \sqrt{(2 - 1)^2 + (2 - 1)^2} \\
& = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} \\
& = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2}
\end{aligned}
\]

Image description: A Cartesian plane with points $P(1,1)$ and $Q(2,2)$ plotted, showing a line segment connecting the two points to illustrate the distance calculation.

\textbf{Example 2.} Plot the origin $O(0,0)$ and the other two points $P(3,0)$ and $Q(0,3)$ on the plane. Find the distance between each of them. What is the name of the geometric figure after joining these three points? And why?

Solution: The positions of the three points have been shown on the plane.

\[
\text{Distance } OP = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{3^2} = 3 \text{ unit}.
\]

\[
\text{Distance } OQ = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{3^2} = 3 \text{ unit}.
\]

\[
\text{Distance } PQ = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3 \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}.
\]

The name of the geometric figure is the isosceles triangle because the distance between the two sides $OP$ and $OQ$ is equal.

Image description: A Cartesian plane showing the origin $O(0,0)$, points $P(3,0)$, and $Q(0,3)$, with line segments forming an isosceles triangle $OPQ$.

\textbf{Example 3.} The three vertices of a triangle are respectively $A(2,0), B(7,0)$ and $C(3,4)$. Plot these points on the plane and construct the triangle. Find the perimeter of the triangle up to five places of decimals.

Solution: The position of $A(2,0), B(7,0)$ and $C(3,4)$ on the plane $xy$ has been shown. Of the triangle $ABC$,

The length of the side $AB$ is

\[
= \sqrt{(7 - 2)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{5^2} = 5 \text{ unit}
\]

The length of the side $BC$ is

\[
= \sqrt{(3 - 7)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{16 + 16} = 4 \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\]

The length of the side $AC$ is

\[
= \sqrt{(3 - 2)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{17} \text{ unit}
\]

$\therefore$ Perimeter of the triangle $=(AB + BC + AC)$ [sum of length of the sides]

\[
= (5 + 4 \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{17}) \text{ unit} = 14.77996 \text{ unit (app.)}
\]

Image description: A Cartesian plane with points $A(2,0)$, $B(7,0)$, and $C(3,4)$ plotted, forming triangle $ABC$ with sides labeled for perimeter calculation.

\textbf{Example 4.} Show that the points, $(0,-1),(-2,3),(6,7)$ and $(8,3)$ are the vertices of a rectangle.

Solution: Let, $A(0,-1), B(-2,3), C(6,7)$ and $D(8,3)$ be the given points. Their position on the plane $xy$ has been shown.

The length of the side $AB$ is

\[
= \sqrt{(-2 - 0)^2 + (3 - (-1))^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + (4)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = 2 \sqrt{5} \text{ unit}
\]

The length of the side $CD$ is

\[
= \sqrt{(8 - 6)^2 + (3 - 7)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = 2 \sqrt{5} \text{ unit}
\]

$\therefore$ The length of the side $AB =$ The length of the side $CD$

Again, the length of the side $AD$ is

\[
= \sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (3 - (-1))^2} = \sqrt{8^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{80} = 4 \sqrt{5} \text{ unit}
\]

The length of the side $BC$ is

\[
= \sqrt{(6 - (-2))^2 + (7 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{8^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{80} = 4 \sqrt{5} \text{ unit}
\]

$\therefore$ The length of the side $AD =$ The length of the side $BC$

$\therefore$ The lengths of the opposite sides are equal. Therefore we can say that, $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.

The length of the diagonal $BD$ is

\[
= \sqrt{(8 - (-2))^2 + (3 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + (0)^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10 \text{ unit}
\]

Now, $BD^2 = 100, AB^2 = (2 \sqrt{5})^2 = 20, AD^2 = (4 \sqrt{5})^2 = 80$

\[
\therefore AB^2 + AD^2 = 20 + 80 = 100 = BD^2
\]

As per the theorem of Pythagoras, $ABD$ is a right angled triangle and $\angle BAD$ is a right angle. So, it is proved that, $ABCD$ is a rectangle.

Image description: A Cartesian plane with points $A(0,-1)$, $B(-2,3)$, $C(6,7)$, and $D(8,3)$ plotted, forming a rectangle $ABCD$ with sides and diagonals labeled to verify the shape.

\textbf{Example 5.} Show that the three points $(-3,-3),(0,0)$ and $(3,3)$ do not form a triangle.

Solution: Let, $A(-3,-3), B(0,0)$ and $C(3,3)$ are the given three points. Their position on the plane $xy$ has been shown.

We know, the sum of the two sides of any triangle is greater than its third side. Let $ABC$ is a triangle and $AB, BC$ and $AC$ be its three sides.

The length of the side $AB$ is

\[
= \sqrt{(0 - (-3))^2 + (0 - (-3))^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{18} = 3 \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\]

The length of the side $BC$ is

\[
= \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{18} = 3 \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\]

The length of the side $AC$ is

\[
= \sqrt{(3 + 3)^2 + (3 + 3)^2} = \sqrt{72} = 6 \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\]

So, $AB + BC = 3 \sqrt{2} + 3 \sqrt{2} = 6 \sqrt{2} = AC$

Therefore, the sum of the two sides is equal to the third side. So it is not possible to form a triangle with them.

Again seeing the positions of three points on plane $xy$, we can say that the three points are on a straight line and so no triangle can be formed by them.

Image description: A Cartesian plane with points $A(-3,-3)$, $B(0,0)$, and $C(3,3)$ plotted, showing they lie on a straight line, confirming they do not form a triangle.

\part{Area of Triangles}
\section*{Area of triangles}

We know we get the region of a triangle if we connect straight lines with three different points that are not lying on the same straight line. That region of the triangle may be different respective of the side and the angle. In this part we will be able to determine the area of any triangle by finding the sides of the triangle with the help of only one formula. With the help of this same formula, by dividing any quadrilateral into the two triangles, the determination of the area of the region of the quadrilateral will be possible. In this case we will determine the area using the perimeter of the triangle (the sum of the lengths of the sides) and the length of the side. To determine the area of a triangle-shaped or angle-shaped land, the method i.e. by the length of side, is very important. So, it is very useful in determining the area of the land. It is said, as the reason, if the coordinates of the vertices of the triangular or quadrangular land are not known or are not possible to know but if the coordinates are known, we will be able to determine the area more easily. In this part we shall determine the area of a triangle or a polygon by these two methods.

\subsection*{Method 1: Determination of the Area Using the Length of Sides and Perimeter}

The determination of the Area: A triangle $ABC$ has been shown in the adjacent figure, $A\left(x_1, y_1\right), B\left(x_2, y_2\right)$ and $C\left(x_3, y_3\right)$ are three different points and $AB, BC$ and $CA$ are the three sides of the triangle. With the help of the formula of determining distance, it is possible to determine easily the lengths of the sides $AB, BC$ and $CA$.

Taking $c$ as the length of side $AB$,

\[
c = \sqrt{\left(x_1 - x_2\right)^2 + \left(y_1 - y_2\right)^2} \text{ unit}
\]

Taking $a$ as the length of side $BC$,

\[
a = \sqrt{\left(x_2 - x_3\right)^2 + \left(y_2 - y_3\right)^2} \text{ unit}
\]

Taking $b$ as the length of side $AC$,

\[
b = \sqrt{\left(x_1 - x_3\right)^2 + \left(y_1 - y_3\right)^2} \text{ unit}
\]

Now taking the perimeter of the triangle as $2s$,

\[
2s = a + b + c \text{ [Perimeter = the sum of the lengths of the three sides.]}
\]

So $s = \frac{1}{2}(a + b + c)$ unit, Here $s$ is the half of the perimeter of the triangle

We can easily determine the area of any triangle with the help of $s$ and $a, b, c$.

The Formula for Determining the Area of Triangular Region

If in $ABC$, the length of the side $AB$ is $c$, the length of the side $BC$ is $a$ and the length of the side $CA$ is $b$ and perimeter is $2s$. So the area of $\triangle ABC$ is

\[
\sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \text{ square unit}
\]

[The proof has been given in the part of mensuration of the Mathematics book of class 9-10. The students should check out the proof.]

By the following examples, the use of the formula will be easily understood.

Observation: There are different formulas for determining the area of different triangles but here we shall able to determine the area of any triangle with the help of only one theory.

\textbf{Example 6.} $A(2,5), B(-1,1)$ and $C(2,1)$ are the three vertices of a triangle. Draw a rough figure of the triangle and find its area by the perimeter and the length of its side. Determine what type of a triangle does it appear to be and justify your answer.

Solution: The triangle has been shown in the figure.

Length of the side $AB$ is,

\[
c = \sqrt{(-1 - 2)^2 + (1 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5 \text{ unit}
\]

Length of the side $BC$ is,

\[
a = \sqrt{(2 + 1)^2 + (1 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 0} = 3 \text{ unit}
\]

Length of the side $AC$ is,

\[
b = \sqrt{(2 - 2)^2 + (1 - 5)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 16} = 4 \text{ unit}
\]

\[
s = \frac{1}{2}(a + b + c) = \frac{1}{2}(3 + 4 + 5) = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ unit}
\]

$\therefore$ Area

\[
= \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{6(6 - 3)(6 - 4)(6 - 5)} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{6 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{6 \times 6} = 6 \text{ square unit}
\]

From the figure we can understand that it is a right angled triangle. It can be proved easily by the theorem of Pythagoras.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& AB^2 = c^2 = 5^2 = 25, BC^2 = a^2 = 3^2 = 9, CA^2 = b^2 = 4^2 = 16 \\
& \therefore BC^2 + CA^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = AB^2
\end{aligned}
\]

$\therefore ABC$ is a right angle triangle. $AB$ is hypotenuse and $\angle ACB$ is a right angle.

Image description: A Cartesian plane with points $A(2,5)$, $B(-1,1)$, and $C(2,1)$ plotted, forming a right-angled triangle $ABC$ with sides labeled for area calculation.

\textbf{Example 7.} $A(2,-4), B(-4,4)$ and $C(3,3)$ are the three vertices of a triangle. Draw the triangle and find the area by determining the length of the side. Determine what type of a triangle does it appear to be and give a name of it and justify your contention.

Solution: The triangle is shown in the figure.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& AB = c = \sqrt{(-4 - 2)^2 + (4 - (-4))^2} \\
& = \sqrt{36 + 64} = \sqrt{100} = 10 \text{ unit}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
& BC = a = \sqrt{(3 - (-4))^2 + (3 - 4)^2} \\
& = \sqrt{49 + 1} = \sqrt{50} = 5 \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
& CA = b = \sqrt{(2 - 3)^2 + (-4 - 3)^2} \\
& = \sqrt{1 + 49} = \sqrt{50} = 5 \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Now, } s = \frac{1}{2}(a + b + c) = \frac{1}{2}(10 + 5 \sqrt{2} + 5 \sqrt{2}) \\
& = 5 + 5 \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\end{aligned}
\]

$\therefore$ Area

\[
= \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{(5 + 5 \sqrt{2})(5 + 5 \sqrt{2} - 10)(5 + 5 \sqrt{2} - 5 \sqrt{2})(5 + 5 \sqrt{2} - 5 \sqrt{2})} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{(5 + 5 \sqrt{2})(5 \sqrt{2} - 5) \cdot 5 \cdot 5} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= 5 \sqrt{(5 + 5 \sqrt{2})(5 \sqrt{2} - 5)} \text{ square unit}
\]

The given triangle is an isosceles triangle. Because $BC = CA = 5 \sqrt{2}$ unit i.e., the two sides of the triangle is equal.

Again,

\[
AB^2 = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
& BC^2 + CA^2 = (5 \sqrt{2})^2 + (5 \sqrt{2})^2 = 50 + 50 = 100 \\
& \therefore AB^2 = BC^2 + CA^2
\end{aligned}
\]

$\therefore \triangle ABC$ is a right angled triangle.

So $\triangle ABC$ is a right angled and isosceles triangle.

Image description: A Cartesian plane with points $A(2,-4)$, $B(-4,4)$, and $C(3,3)$ plotted, forming a right-angled isosceles triangle $ABC$ with sides labeled for area and type verification.

\textbf{Example 8.} The three vertices of a triangle are $A(-2,0), B(5,0)$ and $C(1,4)$ respectively. Find the length of each side and the area of the triangle.

Solution: The triangle is shown in the figure.

\[
\begin{aligned}
& AB = c = \sqrt{(5 - (-2))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} \\
& = \sqrt{49} = 7 \text{ unit}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
& BC = a = \sqrt{(1 - 5)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} \\
& = \sqrt{16 + 16} = 4 \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
& CA = b = \sqrt{(-2 - 1)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} \\
& = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5 \text{ unit}
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\begin{aligned}
& s = \frac{1}{2}(a + b + c) = \frac{1}{2}(7 + 4 \sqrt{2} + 5) \\
& = \frac{1}{2}(12 + 4 \sqrt{2}) = 6 + 2 \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\end{aligned}
\]

$\therefore$ Area

\[
= \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{(6 + 2 \sqrt{2})(6 + 2 \sqrt{2} - 7)(6 + 2 \sqrt{2} - 4 \sqrt{2})(6 + 2 \sqrt{2} - 5)} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{(6 + 2 \sqrt{2})(2 \sqrt{2} - 1)(6 - 2 \sqrt{2})(2 \sqrt{2} + 1)} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{(6 + 2 \sqrt{2})(6 - 2 \sqrt{2})(2 \sqrt{2} + 1)(2 \sqrt{2} - 1)} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{\left(6^2 - (2 \sqrt{2})^2\right)\left((2 \sqrt{2})^2 - 1^2\right)} = \sqrt{28 \cdot 7} = 14 \text{ square unit}
\]

The given triangle is an obtuse angled triangle. Because, it has no side equal to its any other side.

Image description: A Cartesian plane with points $A(-2,0)$, $B(5,0)$, and $C(1,4)$ plotted, forming an obtuse-angled triangle $ABC$ with sides labeled for area calculation.

Observation: Among the three triangular regions whose area we have determined, the first one is a right angled triangle, the second one is an isosceles triangle and the third one is an obtuse angled triangle. The area of each triangle has been determined with the help of only one formula. In the same way we can determine the area of any other triangle.

\textbf{Example 9.} $A(1,0), B(0,1), C(-1,0)$ and $D(0,-1)$ are four vertices of a quadrilateral. Draw the quadrilateral and find the area by determining its length of any two sides and the diagonals.

Solution: In the adjacent figure by plotting the points, the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is shown. $AB, BC, CD$ and $DA$ are the four sides of the quadrilateral and $AC$ and $BD$ are the two diagonals of the quadrilateral.

Side $AB = c$

\[
= \sqrt{(1 - 0)^2 + (0 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\]

Side $BC = a$

\[
= \sqrt{(0 + 1)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\]

Side $AC = b$

\[
= \sqrt{(1 + 1)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{2^2} = 2 \text{ unit}
\]

Side $CD$

\[
= \sqrt{(-1 - 0)^2 + (0 + 1)^2} = \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\]

Side $DA$

\[
= \sqrt{(0 - 1)^2 + (-1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\]

We can see that, $AB = BC = CD = DA = \sqrt{2}$ unit

$\therefore$ The quadrilateral is a square or a rhombus.

Now,

\[
AB^2 + BC^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 + (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 + 2 = 4 = AC^2
\]

$\therefore$ The quadrilateral is a square.

The area of the quadrilateral $ABCD = 2 \times$ the area of the triangle $ABC$.

Now the perimeter of the triangle $ABC$ is

\[
2s = AB + BC + CA = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} + 2 = 2 + 2 \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\]

\[
s = \frac{1}{2}(2 + 2 \sqrt{2}) = 1 + \sqrt{2} \text{ unit}
\]

$\therefore$ The area of the triangle $ABC$ is

\[
= \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{2})(1 + \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2})(1 + \sqrt{2} - 2)(1 + \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2})} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{(\sqrt{2} + 1) \cdot 1 \cdot (\sqrt{2} - 1) \cdot 1} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 - 1} \text{ square unit} = \sqrt{2 - 1} \text{ square unit} = 1 \text{ square unit}
\]

$\therefore$ The area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is

\[
= 2 \times 1 \text{ square unit} = 2 \text{ square unit}.
\]

Remark: By squaring the length of a square, the area can also be found. By multiplying the length and the breadth of a rectangle, the area is also to be found. But the area of any quadrilateral can not to be determined.

Image description: A Cartesian plane with points $A(1,0)$, $B(0,1)$, $C(-1,0)$, and $D(0,-1)$ plotted, forming a square $ABCD$ with sides and diagonals labeled for area calculation.

\textbf{Example 10.} Draw the quadrilateral having its vertices at the points $A(-1,1)$, $B(2,-1), C(3,3)$ and $D(1,6)$. Find the length of its each side and one of its diagonals and also the area of the quadrilateral.

Solution: By plotting the points on the plane $xy$, the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is shown. In the quadrilateral $ABCD$,

Side $AB = a$

\[
= \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{13} \text{ unit}
\]

Side $BC = b$

\[
= \sqrt{1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{17} \text{ unit}
\]

Side $CD = d$

\[
= \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{13} \text{ unit}
\]

Side $DA = e$

\[
= \sqrt{2^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{29} \text{ unit}
\]

Diagonal $AC = c$

\[
= \sqrt{4^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{20} \text{ unit}
\]

In $\triangle ABC, 2s = a + b + c = (\sqrt{13} + \sqrt{17} + \sqrt{20})$ unit

\[
= (3.6056 + 4.1231 + 4.4721) \text{ unit} = 12.2008 \text{ unit}
\]

\[
\therefore s = 6.1004 \text{ unit}
\]

Area of $\triangle ABC$ is

\[
= \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{6.1004 \times 2.4948 \times 1.9773 \times 1.6283} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{49.000} \text{ square unit} = 7 \text{ square unit}
\]

In $\triangle ACD, 2s = c + d + e = (\sqrt{20} + \sqrt{13} + \sqrt{29})$ unit

\[
= (4.4721 + 3.6056 + 5.3852) \text{ unit} = 13.4629 \text{ unit}
\]

\[
\therefore s = 6.7315 \text{ unit}.
\]

Area of $\triangle ACD$ is

\[
= \sqrt{s(s - c)(s - d)(s - e)} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{6.7315 \times 2.2591 \times 3.1256 \times 1.3460} \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{63.9744} \text{ square unit} = 7.9983 \text{ square unit}
\]

$\therefore$ Area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is

\[
= (7.000 + 7.998) \text{ square unit} = 14.998 \text{ square unit} = 15 \text{ square unit (app.)}
\]

Remark: The quadrilateral is not a square or a rectangle or a parallelogram or a rhombus. This method is very useful in determining the area of such an obtuse shaped land.

Image description: A Cartesian plane with points $A(-1,1)$, $B(2,-1)$, $C(3,3)$, and $D(1,6)$ plotted, forming a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with sides and diagonal $AC$ labeled for area calculation.

\textbf{Example 11.} The coordinates of the four points are respectively $A(2,-3)$, $B(3,0), C(0,1)$ and $D(-1,-2)$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $ABCD$ is a rhombus.
    \item Find the length of $AC$ and $BD$ and ascertain whether $ABCD$ is a square.
    \item Find the area of the quadrilateral by the region of triangle.
\end{enumerate}

Solution: By plotting the points, the quadrilateral $ABCD$ has been shown in the figure.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose, $a, b, c, d$ are the length of the sides $AB, BC, CD$ and $DA$ respectively and the diagonal $AC = e$ and the diagonal $BD = f$.

    \[
    a = \sqrt{(3 - 2)^2 + (0 + 3)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{10} \text{ unit}
    \]

    \[
    b = \sqrt{(0 - 3)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{10} \text{ unit}
    \]

    \[
    c = \sqrt{(-1 - 0)^2 + (-2 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{10} \text{ unit}
    \]

    \[
    d = \sqrt{(2 + 1)^2 + (-3 + 2)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{10} \text{ unit}
    \]

    Since $a = b = c = d = \sqrt{10}$ unit

    $\therefore ABCD$ is a rhombus.

    \item Diagonal $AC = e$

    \[
    = \sqrt{(0 - 2)^2 + (1 + 3)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20} \text{ unit}
    \]

    and diagonal $BD = f$

    \[
    = \sqrt{(-1 - 3)^2 + (-2 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{20} \text{ unit}
    \]

    $\therefore$ It is seen that $AC = BD$ therefore, the diagonals are equal.

    \[
    AC^2 = (\sqrt{20})^2 = 20
    \]

    \[
    AB^2 + BC^2 = (\sqrt{10})^2 + (\sqrt{10})^2 = 10 + 10 = 20 = AC^2
    \]

    $\therefore$ According to the theorem of Pythagoras $\angle ABC$ is a right angle.

    $\therefore$ The quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a square.

    \item Area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is

    \[
    = 2 \times \text{area of the triangle } ABC
    \]

    Here in the case of $\triangle ABC$,

    \[
    s = \frac{1}{2}(a + b + c) = \frac{\sqrt{10} + \sqrt{10} + \sqrt{20}}{2} = \frac{2 \sqrt{10} + 2 \sqrt{5}}{2} = \sqrt{10} + \sqrt{5}
    \]

    $\therefore$ Area of $\triangle ABC$,

    \[
    = \sqrt{s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} \text{ square unit}
    \]

    \[
    = \sqrt{(\sqrt{10} + \sqrt{5})(\sqrt{10} + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{10})(\sqrt{10} + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{10})(\sqrt{10} + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{20})} \text{ square unit}
    \]

    \[
    = \sqrt{(\sqrt{10} + \sqrt{5}) \cdot \sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{5} \cdot (\sqrt{10} - \sqrt{5})} \text{ square unit}
    \]

    \[
    = \sqrt{5 \cdot \left((\sqrt{10})^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2\right)} = \sqrt{5 \cdot 5} = 5 \text{ square unit}
    \]

    $\therefore$ Area of square $ABCD$ is

    \[
    = 2 \times 5 \text{ square unit} = 10 \text{ square unit}.
    \]

    Remark: Easy method: the area of a square $ABCD = (\sqrt{10})^2 = 10$ square unit.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Method 2: Determination of the Area Using the Coordinates of the Vertices}

By this method the area of a triangle can be determined very easily with the help of the coordinates of the three vertices of a triangle. If the coordinates of the vertices of any polygon are known, the area of the polygon can also be determined in the same way. However, in real life, it is not possible to use this method. This is because if we want to determine the area of a land and if the shape of the land is triangle or square, the area can not be determined by this method since the coordinates of the angular points are not known or are not possible to know. But we can easily measure the length of the sides of a land and determine the area by the Method 1. So, it is necessary for the students to have conceptions about both methods. Method 2 for determining the area of triangles and polygons is discussed below with examples:

The General Formula of Determining the Area of a Triangle: Let, $A\left(x_1, y_1\right), B\left(x_2, y_2\right)$ and $C\left(x_3, y_3\right)$ be the three vertices of the triangle $ABC$. Like the figure similar to below, the points $A, B$ and $C$ are arranged in anti-clockwise order.

From the figure we get,

Area of polygon $ABCDF = \text{area of triangle } ABC + \text{area of trapezium } ACDF$.

\[
= \text{area of trapezium } ABEF + \text{area of trapezium } BCDE.
\]

Therefore we get,

Area of triangle $ABC = \text{area of trapezium } ABEF + \text{area of trapezium } BCDE$

- area of trapezium $ACDF$,

$\therefore$ Area of the Triangle $ABC$

\[
\begin{aligned}
& = \frac{1}{2} \times (BE + AF) \times EF + \frac{1}{2} \times (CD + BE) \times DE - \frac{1}{2} \times (CD + AF) \times DF \\
& = \frac{1}{2} \times \left(y_2 + y_1\right) \times \left(x_1 - x_2\right) + \frac{1}{2} \times \left(y_3 + y_2\right) \times \left(x_2 - x_3\right) - \frac{1}{2} \times \left(y_3 + y_1\right) \times \left(x_1 - x_3\right) \\
& = \frac{1}{2} \left(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_1 - x_2 y_1 - x_3 y_2 - x_1 y_3\right) \\
& = \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{array}{cccc} x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & x_1 \\ y_1 & y_2 & y_3 & y_1 \end{array} \right|
\end{aligned}
\]

Where in the side of multiplication as the positive sign $\searrow$ we get $x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_1$ and as the negative sign $\nearrow$ we get $-x_2 y_1 - x_3 y_2 - x_1 y_3$

So, area of triangle $\triangle ABC$

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{array}{cccc} x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & x_1 \\ y_1 & y_2 & y_3 & y_1 \end{array} \right| \text{ square unit}
\]

Remark: It is very important to remember that in applying this formula, the vertices $\left| \begin{array}{cccc} x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & x_1 \\ y_1 & y_2 & y_3 & y_1 \end{array} \right|$ must be taken in anti-clockwise order.

Image description: A diagram illustrating the area calculation of triangle $ABC$ using trapeziums $ABEF$, $BCDE$, and $ACDF$ on a Cartesian plane, with vertices $A(x_1, y_1)$, $B(x_2, y_2)$, and $C(x_3, y_3)$ arranged anti-clockwise.

\textbf{Example 12.} Find the area of the triangle $ABC$ with the vertices $A(2,3)$, $B(5,6)$ and $C(-1,4)$.

Solution: The vertices $A(2,3), B(5,6)$ and $C(-1,4)$ are taken in anti-clockwise order.

Area of $\triangle ABC$

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{array}{cccc} 2 & 5 & -1 & 2 \\ 3 & 6 & 4 & 3 \end{array} \right| \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} (12 + 20 - 3 - 15 + 6 - 8) \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} (12) \text{ square unit} = 6 \text{ square unit}
\]

\textbf{Example 13.} The vertices of a triangle are $A(1,3), B(5,1)$ and $C(3, r)$ and its area is 4 square unit. Find the possible value of $r$.

Solution: Considering the vertices $A(1,3), B(5,1)$ and $C(3, r)$ are in anti-clockwise order, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is

\[
\begin{aligned}
& = \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 5 & 3 & 1 \\ 3 & 1 & r & 3 \end{array} \right| \text{ square unit} \\
& = \frac{1}{2} (1 + 5r + 9 - 15 - 3 - r) \text{ square unit} \\
& = \frac{1}{2} (4r - 8) = (2r - 4) \text{ square unit}
\end{aligned}
\]

According to the question,

\[
|(2r - 4)| = 4
\]

\[
\text{or, } \pm (2r - 4) = 4
\]

\[
\text{or, } 2r - 4 = \pm 4
\]

Therefore,

\[
2r = 0 \text{ or, } 8
\]

\[
\therefore r = 0, 4
\]

\part{Area of Quadrilateral}
\section*{Area of Quadrilateral}

In the figure below $ABCD$ is a quadrilateral. Its vertices are $A\left(x_1, y_1\right), B\left(x_2, y_2\right)$, $C\left(x_3, y_3\right), D\left(x_4, y_4\right)$ respectively and $A, B, C, D$ are arranged in anti-clockwise order.

Now area of quadrilateral $ABCD = \text{area of triangle } ABC + \text{area of triangle } ACD$

\[
\begin{aligned}
& = \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{array}{cccc} x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & x_1 \\ y_1 & y_2 & y_3 & y_1 \end{array} \right| + \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{array}{cccc} x_1 & x_3 & x_4 & x_1 \\ y_1 & y_3 & y_4 & y_1 \end{array} \right| \\
& = \frac{1}{2} \left(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_1 - x_2 y_1 - x_3 y_2 - x_1 y_3\right) + \frac{1}{2} \left(x_1 y_3 + x_3 y_4 + x_4 y_1 - x_3 y_1 - x_4 y_3 - x_1 y_4\right)
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_4 + x_4 y_1 - x_2 y_1 - x_3 y_2 - x_4 y_3 - x_1 y_4\right)
\]

So, the area of Quadrilateral $ABCD$

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{array}{ccccc} x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & x_4 & x_1 \\ y_1 & y_2 & y_3 & y_4 & y_1 \end{array} \right| \text{ square unit}
\]

Similarly, if $A\left(x_1, y_1\right), B\left(x_2, y_2\right), C\left(x_3, y_3\right), D\left(x_4, y_4\right)$ and $E\left(x_5, y_5\right)$ are the vertices of a pentagon $ABCDE$, and if the vertices are arranged in anti-clockwise order, the area of the pentagon $ABCDE$ is the sum of the area of the three triangles $ABC, ACD$ and $ADE$.

Like the area of the triangle and the quadrilateral, just in the same way, the area of the pentagon $ABCDE$

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{array}{cccccc} x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & x_4 & x_5 & x_1 \\ y_1 & y_2 & y_3 & y_4 & y_5 & y_1 \end{array} \right| \text{ square unit}
\]

If the coordinates of the vertices of any polygon are to be known, in the same way we can determine the area easily following the above method.

\textbf{Example 14.} Find the area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ with vertices $A(1,4)$, $B(-4,3), C(1,-2)$ and $D(4,0)$.

Solution: Taking the vertices in anti-clockwise order, the area of the quadrilateral is

\[
ABCD = \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & -4 & 1 & 4 & 1 \\ 4 & 3 & -2 & 0 & 4 \end{array} \right| \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} (3 + 8 + 0 + 16 + 16 - 3 + 8 - 0) \text{ square unit}
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} (48) \text{ square unit} = 24 \text{ square unit}
\]

\part{Gradient or Slope of a Straight Line}
\section*{Gradient or Slope of a Straight Line}

In this part of Coordinate Geometry, at first we shall discuss what Gradient or Slope means and how to determine the Slope or the Gradient of a straight line. By using the concept of the slope how the algebraic form of the straight line appears to be will be discussed. If any straight line passes through two points, the nature of that straight line and the determination of the equation of that straight line are mainly the subject matter of the discussion. If two straight lines meet or intersect at any point, determining the coordinates of that intersecting point and triangles formed by three straight lines denoted by three equations will also be discussed.

\subsection*{Gradient or Slope}

In the figure beside, let's consider the straight line $AB$. The line passes through the two points $A(2,3)$ and $B(6,7)$. According to the figure, the line produces an angle $\theta$ with the positive side of $x$ axis. The angle $\theta$ is the measurement of the inclination of the straight line $AB$ with the horizontal $x$-axis. In Coordinate Geometry, we measure the Gradient $m$ of the line $AB$ in the following way:

\[
\frac{m}{7-3} = \frac{\text{Change of the coordinate of } y}{\frac{4}{6-2} = \frac{4}{4} = 1} = 1
\]

$\therefore$ gradient of the line $AB, m = 1$

Generally, when a straight line $AB$ passes through the points $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$, we express the gradient $(m)$ as

\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \left[ \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} \right] = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}
\]

In reality, the relation between the slope $m$ and the angle $\theta$ produced by any straight line with the positive side of $x$-axis is, $m = \tan \theta$. In the figure above, in case of $AB$, slope of the line is $m = 1$ i.e., $\tan \theta = 1$ or, $\theta = 45^\circ$ (an acute angle)

Image description: A Cartesian plane showing a straight line $AB$ passing through points $A(2,3)$ and $B(6,7)$, with an angle $\theta$ formed with the positive $x$-axis, illustrating the slope calculation.

\textbf{Example 15.} In each of the following cases find the slope of the straight line passing through the given pair of points:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A(2,3)$ and $B(3,6)$
    \item $A'(2,1)$ and $B'(-1,4)$
\end{enumerate}

Solution:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Slope of the line $AB = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{6 - 3}{3 - 2} = \frac{3}{1} = 3$
    \item Slope of the line $A'B' = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{4 - 1}{-1 - 2} = \frac{3}{-3} = -1$
\end{enumerate}

Note: In the above figure, it can be seen that the slope of the line $AB$ is positive and the angle produced is an acute angle. Again from the same figure, it is clear that the slope of the line $AB$ is negative and the angle produced is an obtuse angle. Therefore, from the above discussion we come to the conclusion, if the slope is positive, the angle produced by the line with the positive side of the $x$-axis is an acute angle and if the slope is negative, the angle produced by the line with the positive side of the $x$-axis is an obtuse angle.

If the produced angle is zero or right angle, what will be the slope? This has been explained with the help of the following example:

\textbf{Example 16.} The coordinates of the three points $A, B$ and $C$ are respectively $(2,2),(5,2)$ and $(2,7)$. Draw the lines $AB$ and $AC$ on the Cartesian plane. If possible, find the slopes of the lines $AB$ and $AC$.

Solution: The lines $AB$ and $AC$ have been drawn on the Cartesian plane.

From the figure, it is observed that the line $AB$ is parallel to the $x$ axis, while the line $AC$ is parallel to the $y$-axis.

Slope of $AB, m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{2 - 2}{5 - 2} = \frac{0}{3} = 0$

Slope of $AC$ can not be determined by the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ because $x_1 = x_2 = 2$ and $x_2 - x_1 = 0$. If $x_1 = x_2$ then the slope of the line is not determined but the line is parallel to the $y$-axis.

Generally any straight line passing through the point $A\left(x_1, y_1\right)$ and $B\left(x_2, y_2\right)$ has the slope,

\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}, m = \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} \text{ if } x_1 \neq x_2
\]

Observe: If $x_1 = x_2$, the line is parallel to the $y$-axis i.e., a perpendicular on the $x$-axis. It is not possible to walk on the perpendicular line or the vertical line. So, the determination of the slope is not possible.

Remark: In the above figure, on any point of the line $AB$, the ordinate i.e., $y = 2$ and on any point of the line $AC$, the abscissa i.e., $x = 2$. Therefore, the equation of the straight line $AB$ is $y = 2$ and the equation of the straight line $AC$ is $x = 2$.

Image description: A Cartesian plane with points $A(2,2)$, $B(5,2)$, and $C(2,7)$ plotted, showing line $AB$ parallel to the $x$-axis and line $AC$ parallel to the $y$-axis, illustrating their slopes.

\textbf{Example 17.} Find the slope of the line passing through the points $A(-3,2)$ and $B(3,-2)$.

Solution: If $m$ is the slope of $AB$, then

\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{2 - (-2)}{-3 - 3} = \frac{4}{-6} = \frac{2}{-3}
\]

As the slope is negative, the angle produced by the line with the positive direction of the $x$-axis is an obtuse angle.

\textbf{Example 18.} What is the value of $t$ if the three points $A(1,-1), B(2,2)$ and $C(4, t)$ are collinear?

Solution: As they are collinear, their slopes will be same. So, we get,

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{2 + 1}{2 - 1} = \frac{t - 2}{4 - 2} \\
& \text{or, } \frac{3}{1} = \frac{t - 2}{2} \\
& \text{or, } t - 2 = 6 \\
& \text{or, } t = 8
\end{aligned}
\]

So, value of $t$ is 8.

\textbf{Example 19.} $A(t, 3t), B\left(t^2, 2t\right), C(t-2, t)$ and $D(1,1)$ are the four different points. If the lines $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel, find the admissible value of $t$.

Solution: Slope of $AB, m_1 = \frac{2t - 3t}{t^2 - t} = \frac{-t}{t(t - 1)} = \frac{1}{1 - t}$

Slope of $CD, m_2 = \frac{1 - t}{1 - t + 2} = \frac{1 - t}{3 - t}$

As the lines $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel, they have the same slope i.e., $m_1 = m_2$

\[
\text{or, } \frac{1}{1 - t} = \frac{1 - t}{3 - t}
\]

\[
\text{or, } (1 - t)^2 = (3 - t)
\]

\[
\text{or, } 1 - 2t + t^2 = 3 - t
\]

\[
\text{or, } t^2 - t - 2 = 0
\]

\[
\text{or, } t = -1 \text{ or } t = 2
\]

So, possible values of $t$ are -1 and 2.

\section*{Equation of Straight Lines}

Suppose, a definite straight line $L$ passes through two definite points $A(3,4)$ and $B(5,7)$. In the figure below, the line is shown.

Then the slope of the straight line $AB$ is

\[
m_1 = \frac{7 - 4}{5 - 3} = \frac{3}{2} \ldots (1)
\]

Suppose, $P(x, y)$ is any point on the line $L$. Then the slope of the line $AP$ is

\[
m_2 = \frac{y - 4}{x - 3} \ldots (2)
\]

Since $AB$ and $AP$ are segments of the same line, both have the same slope. i.e.

\[
m_1 = m_2
\]

\[
\text{or, } \frac{3}{2} = \frac{y - 4}{x - 3} \text{ [From (1) and (2)]}
\]

\[
\text{or, } 3x - 9 = 2y - 8
\]

\[
\text{or, } 2y = 3x - 1
\]

\[
\text{or, } y = \frac{3}{2} x - \frac{1}{2} \ldots (3)
\]

Again, slope of $PB, m_3 = \frac{7 - y}{5 - x} \ldots (4)$

As slopes of $AB$ and $PB$ are same,

\[
\begin{aligned}
& m_1 = m_3 \\
& \text{or, } \frac{3}{2} = \frac{7 - y}{5 - x} \text{ [From (1) and (4)]} \\
& \text{or, } 15 - 3x = 14 - 2y \\
& \text{or, } 2y + 15 = 3x + 14 \\
& \text{or, } 2y = 3x - 1 \\
& \text{or, } y = \frac{3}{2} x - \frac{1}{2} \ldots (5)
\end{aligned}

The equation (3) and (5) is the same equation. So, the equation (3) or (5) is the Cartesian equation of the straight line $L$. If we observe, we will find that the equation (3) or (5) is the single equation of $x$ and $y$ and it indicates a straight line. So, undoubtedly it can be said that the single equation of $x$ and $y$ always indicates a straight line. The equations (3) and (5) can be expressed in the following way:

\[
y = \frac{3}{2} x - \frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
\frac{y - 4}{x - 3} = \frac{3}{2} \text{ or } \frac{y - 7}{x - 5} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

\[
\text{i.e., } \frac{y - 4}{x - 3} = \frac{7 - 4}{5 - 3} \text{ or } \frac{y - 7}{x - 5} = \frac{7 - 4}{5 - 3}
\]

\[
\text{i.e., } \frac{y - 4}{x - 3} = m \text{ or } \frac{y - 7}{x - 5} = m
\]

Therefore, it is said usually, if two definite points $A\left(x_1, y_1\right)$ and $B\left(x_2, y_2\right)$ lie on any straight line, the slope

\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \left[ \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} \right]
\]

and the Cartesian equation of that straight line will be:

\[
\frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} = m \ldots (6), \frac{y - y_2}{x - x_2} = m \ldots (7)
\]

From equation (6):

\[
y - y_1 = m \left(x - x_1\right) \ldots (8)
\]

From equation (7):

\[
y - y_2 = m \left(x - x_2\right) \ldots (9)
\]

$\therefore$ From (8) and (9) we can say, if the slope of the line is $m$ and the line passes through the definite points $\left(x_1, y_1\right)$ and $\left(x_2, y_2\right)$, the Cartesian equation of the line will be determined by the equation (8) or (9). From the equation (6) and (7) we get,

\[
m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} = \frac{y - y_2}{x - x_2} \ldots (10)
\]

From the equation (10), it is said clearly, if a straight line passes through two definite points $A\left(x_1, y_1\right)$ and $B\left(x_2, y_2\right)$, its Cartesian equation will be

\[
\frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} = \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} \text{ or } \frac{y - y_2}{x - x_2} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \ldots (11)
\]

\[
\text{As, } m = \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]

The above discussion is explained with the help of the following examples so that the students can easily understand the slope of the straight line and the equation.

Image description: A Cartesian plane showing a straight line $L$ passing through points $A(3,4)$ and $B(5,7)$, with a point $P(x,y)$ on the line, used to derive the equation of the line.

\textbf{Example 20.} Find the equation of the straight line connecting the points $A(3,4)$ and $B(6,7)$.

Solution: Slope of $AB, m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{7 - 4}{6 - 3} = \frac{3}{3} = 1$

By applying the equation (8), the equation of the line $AB$ is,

\[
y - 4 = 1 (x - 3)
\]

\[
\text{or, } y - 4 = x - 3
\]

\[
\text{or, } y = x + 1
\]

By applying the equation (9), the equation of the line $AB$ is,

\[
y - 7 = 1 (x - 6)
\]

\[
\text{or, } y = x + 1
\]

By applying the equation (11), the equation of the line $AB$ is

\[
\frac{y - 4}{x - 3} = \frac{4 - 7}{3 - 6}
\]

\[
\text{or, } \frac{y - 4}{x - 3} = \frac{-3}{-3} = 1
\]

\[
\text{or, } y - 4 = x - 3
\]

\[
\text{or, } y = x + 1
\]

Observe that, by applying any one of the formula (8) or (9) or (11), the equation of the straight line connecting two definite points can be determined. The learners can use either one according to their convenience.

\textbf{Example 21.} The slope of a definite straight line is 3 and the connecting point of the line is $(-2,-3)$. Find the equation of the line.

Solution: Given that, slope $m = 3$ and the definite point $\left(x_1, y_1\right) = (-2,-3)$

$\therefore$ The equation of the line,

\[
y - y_1 = m \left(x - x_1\right)
\]

\[
\text{or, } y - (-3) = 3 \{ x - (-2) \}
\]

\[
\text{or, } y + 3 = 3 (x + 2)
\]

\[
\text{or, } y = 3x + 3
\]

$\therefore$ Required equation, $y = 3x + 3$

\textbf{Example 22.} The straight line $y = 3x + 3$ passes through the point $P(t, 4)$. Find the coordinate of $P$. The line intersects the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis on the points $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the coordinates of the points $A$ and $B$.

Solution: The point $P(t, 4)$ lies on the line $y = 3x + 3$; so coordinates of $P$ will satisfy the equation of the line.

So,

\[
4 = 3 \cdot t + 3
\]

\[
\text{or, } 3t = 4 - 3
\]

\[
\text{or, } t = \frac{1}{3}
\]

$\therefore$ The coordinate of $P$ is $(t, 4) = P\left(\frac{1}{3}, 4\right)$

The line $y = 3x + 3$ intersects the $x$-axis at $A$. So, the ordinate or $y$ coordinate of the point $A$ is 0. [Since $y$ is 0 on all points of the $x$-axis.]

\[
\text{or, } 0 = 3x + 3 \text{ or, } x = -1
\]

$\therefore$ coordinate of $A$ is $(-1,0)$

Again, the line $y = 3x + 3$ intersects the $y$-axis at $B$. So, the abscissa or $x$ coordinate of the point $B$ is 0. [Since $x$ is 0 on all points of the $y$-axis.]

So,

\[
y = 3 \cdot 0 + 3 \text{ or, } y = 3
\]

$\therefore$ Coordinate of $B$ is $(0,3)$

Now, draw the line $AB$ on the Cartesian plane. The line $AB$ intersects the $x$-axis at the point $(-1,0)$ and the $y$-axis at the point $(0,3)$. i.e., when the value of $x$ is -1, the line $y = 3x + 3$ intersects the $x$-axis. Again, when the value of $y$ is 3, the line intersects the $y$-axis. So, the bisector $x$ of the line is -1 and bisector $y$ is 3.

The general equation of such straight line which is not vertical can be expressed in the following way.

\[
y = mx + c
\]

Here, the slope of the line is $m$ and $c$ is the bisector of the $y$-axis. For $m > 0$ and $c > 0$ of the line is shown in the first figure.

Again, parallel to the $y$-axis, i.e., the general equation of the perpendicular line on the $x$-axis is $x = a$. In the same way, parallel to the $x$-axis, i.e., the general equation of the perpendicular line on the $y$-axis is $y = b$. See the first figure.

Observed, as the value of $c$ is positive, the line $y = mx + c$ intersects $c$ to the positive side of the $y$-axis at a single distance. As the value of $m (m = \tan \theta > 0)$ is positive, the angle produced by the line $y = mx + c$ is an acute angle. As the values of $a$ and $b$ are positive, the line $x = a$ has been on the right side of the $y$-axis and the line $y = b$ has been shown above the $x$-axis.

In the case of the negative values of $a, b$ and $c$, the position of the lines are shown in the second figure.

Image description: Two figures on a Cartesian plane. The first figure shows lines $y = mx + c$ (with positive $m$ and $c$), $x = a$, and $y = b$ with positive $a$ and $b$. The second figure shows the same lines with negative $a$, $b$, and $c$, illustrating their positions relative to the axes.

From first two figures and above discussion, we can say clearly, if $c = 0$, the line $y = mx$ will pass through the origin $(0,0)$ and if $a = 0$, the line will pass through $y$-axis and if $b = 0$, it will pass through $x$-axis.

\textbf{Example 23.} Find the slope and the intersector of the straight line $y - 2x + 3 = 0$. Draw the line on the Cartesian plane.

Solution:

\[
y - 2x + 3 = 0
\]

\[
\text{or, } y = 2x - 3 \text{ [ shape of } y = mx + c \text{ ] }
\]

$\therefore$ Slope, $m = 2$ and Intersector of $y$-axis is $c = -3$

Now, if the line intersects the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis at $A$ and $B$, we get,

The coordinates of the point $A$ is $\left(\frac{3}{2}, 0\right)$

[Putting in $x$-axis $y = 0$, $x = \frac{3}{2}$]

The coordinates of the point $B$ is $(0,-3)$

[Putting $x = 0$ in $y$-axis, we get $y = -3$]

The line is drawn on the Cartesian plane.

Image description: A Cartesian plane showing the line $y = 2x - 3$, intersecting the $x$-axis at $\left(\frac{3}{2}, 0\right)$ and the $y$-axis at $(0,-3)$, with slope and intercepts labeled.

\textbf{Example 24.} The line joining the points $A(-1,3)$ and $B(5,15)$ intersects the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis at the points $P$ and $Q$ respectively. Find the equation of the line $PQ$ and the length of $PQ$.

Solution: The equation of the line $AB$,

\[
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{y - 3}{x + 1} = \frac{3 - 15}{-1 - 5} \\
& = \frac{-12}{-6} = 2
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\text{or, } y - 3 = 2x + 2
\]

\[
\text{or, } y = 2x + 5 \ldots (1)
\]

From (1), the coordinate of $P$ is $\left(-\frac{5}{2}, 0\right)$ and the coordinate of $Q$ is $(0,5)$

$\therefore$ the equation of the line $PQ$,

\[
\frac{y - 0}{x + \frac{5}{2}} = \frac{0 - 5}{\frac{5}{2} - 0}
\]

\[
\text{or, } \frac{2y}{2x + 5} = \frac{-10}{5} = \frac{2}{1}
\]

\[
\text{or, } 2y = 4x + 10
\]

\[
\text{or, } y = 2x + 5
\]

Remark: $AB$ and $PQ$ are the same straight line.

Now, length of $PQ$

\[
= \sqrt{\left(-\frac{5}{2} - 0\right)^2 + (0 - 5)^2}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{\frac{25}{4} + 25} = \sqrt{\frac{125}{4}} = \frac{5 \sqrt{5}}{2} \text{ unit}
\]

\textbf{Example 25.} $A(3,4), B(-4,2), C(6,-1)$ and $D(k, 3)$ points rotate anti-clockwise.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that the connecting straight line between points $A$ and $B$ form an acute angle with $x$-axis.
    \item If $P(x, y)$ point is equidistant from $A$ and $B$ then show that, $14x + 4y = 5$
    \item Determine the value of $k$ if the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is thrice that of $\triangle ABC$.
\end{enumerate}

Solution:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the slope of $AB$ is $m$,

    \[
    m = \frac{2 - 4}{-4 - 3} = \frac{-2}{-7} = \frac{2}{7}
    \]

    As the slope is positive, the line forms acute angle with positive $x$-axis.

    \item

    \[
    PA = \sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2} \text{ and } PB = \sqrt{(x + 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2}
    \]

    As $P$ is equidistant from $A$ and $B, PA = PB$

    \[
    \therefore \sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2} = \sqrt{(x + 4)^2 + (y - 2)^2}
    \]

    \[
    \text{or, } x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 - 8y + 16 = x^2 + 8x + 16 + y^2 - 4y + 4
    \]

    \[
    \text{or, } -6x - 8y - 8x + 4y = 20 - 25
    \]

    \[
    \text{or, } -14x - 4y = -5
    \]

    \[
    \therefore 14x + 4y = 5
    \]

    \item Area of quadrilateral $ABCD$

    \[
    = \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{array}{rrrrr} 3 & -4 & 6 & k & 3 \\ 4 & 2 & -1 & 3 & 4 \end{array} \right|
    \]

    \[
    = \frac{1}{2} \{ 6 + 4 + 18 + 4k - (-16 + 12 - k + 9) \} = \frac{1}{2} (28 + 4k - 5 + k) = \frac{1}{2} (23 + 5k)
    \]

    Area of triangle $ABC$

    \[
    = \frac{1}{2} \left| \begin{array}{rrrr} 3 & -4 & 6 & 3 \\ 4 & 2 & -1 & 4 \end{array} \right|
    \]

    \[
    = \frac{1}{2} \{ 6 + 4 + 24 - (-16 + 12 - 3) \} = \frac{41}{2}
    \]

    According to the question,

    \[
    \frac{1}{2} (23 + 5k) = 3 \times \frac{41}{2}
    \]

    \[
    \text{or, } 23 + 5k = 123
    \]

    \[
    \text{or, } 5k = 100 \text{ or, } k = 20
    \]

    \[
    \therefore k = 20
    \]
\end{enumerate}
