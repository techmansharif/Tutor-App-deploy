\chapter*{Chapter 14: Probability}

In our everyday life we frequently use the word 'probability.' For example, the probability of Jaadob passing the SSC examination this year is really poor, the probability of Bangladesh winning the Asia cup is high, the probability of the temperature rising tomorrow is high, the probability of raining today is very thin etc.

Therefore, we talk about probability only when there is a doubt about an event occurring. And the possibility of the event occurring also depends on the magnitude of non-occurrence. But this procedure can not give any numerical value. In this chapter, we will know about different formulas and procedures for assigning a numerical value to the probability of the occurrence of an event, and we will also be able to describe certain events, impossible events and possible events after studying this chapter.

After studying this chapter, students will be able to

\begin{itemize}
    \item explain the concept of probability;
    \item describe certain events, impossible events and possible events by giving daily-life examples;
    \item describe the consequences of repetition of an event;
    \item find the probability of an event happening repeatedly;
    \item solve simple and real-life problems regarding probability.
\end{itemize}

\part{Basic Concepts and Logic-Based Probability}

\section*{Basic Concepts Related to Probability}

\textbf{Random Experiment}: A random experiment is where you know all possible outcomes of the experiment, but you can not say the exact outcome of a certain attempt in this experiment. For example, we know all the outcomes of throwing a dice, but we can not exactly tell which outcome will occur before throwing the dice. So the experiment of throwing a dice is a random experiment.

\textbf{Event}: An outcome or a combination of outcomes of an experiment is called an event. For example, getting 3 after throwing a dice is an event. Again, getting an even number in this regard is also an event.

\textbf{Equally Likely Events}: If the possibilities of the outcomes of a random experiment occurring are same, which means no outcome is more or less likely to happen than any other outcome, the possible outcomes are called equally likely events. For example, the occurrence of a head or a tail in the tossing of a coin are equally likely events, unless the coin is defective or biased in some way. Therefore, getting head and tail are equally likely events.

\textbf{Mutually Exclusive Events}: Two or more possible outcomes of a random experiment are called mutually exclusive event if the occurrence of one of those events precludes the possibility of the other events. For example, in the tossing of a coin, the occurrence of a head and a tail are mutually exclusive events since if head occurs then tail can not occur and vice versa. That means head and tail can not occur at the same time.

\textbf{Favourable Outcomes}: The outcome of interest of an event in an experiment is called favourable outcome. The number of favourable outcomes of getting an odd number on throwing a dice is 3.

\textbf{Sample Space and Sample Point}: The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the sample space. The tossing of a coin has two possible outcomes: Head and Tail. If the result of this experiment is expressed as $S$, we can write $S = \{H, T\}$. So in this case the sample space is $S = \{H, T\}$. Suppose two coins are tossed simultaneously. Then the sample space is $S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$. Every element of a sample space is called a sample point. The experiment of throwing a dice once has the sample space $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$, and here each of $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ is a sample point.

\section*{Determination of Logic-Based Probabilities}

\textbf{Example 1.} Suppose an unbiased dice is thrown. What is the probability of getting 5?

Solution: The possible outcomes of throwing a dice are: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$. Since the dice is unbiased, these outcomes are all equally likely. So the possibility of a particular outcome is one-sixth. So the probability of getting 5 is $\frac{1}{6}$. We write this as $P(5) = \frac{1}{6}$.

\textbf{Example 2.} What is the probability of getting an even number on throwing an unbiased dice?

Solution: The possible outcomes of throwing a dice are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$. The even numbers among these outcomes are $2, 4, 6$. So there are three outcomes where we can get an even number on the dice, which means there are 3 favourable outcomes. As all outcomes are equally likely, the probability of getting an even number on the dice is $\frac{3}{6}$.

$\therefore P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6}$.

So we can formalize the following definition of probability:

\[
\text{Probability of an event} = \frac{\text{number of cases favourable to the event}}{\text{total number of possible outcomes}}
\]

The number of cases favourable to an event can be minimum zero and maximum $n$ (all possible outcomes). If there is no case favourable to an event then probability becomes zero. And when the amount of favourable outcome is $n$, then the probability is 1. Therefore, the probability of an event ranges from 0 to 1.

\section*{Two Special Events}

\textbf{Certain Events}: An event which is sure to occur is called a certain event. The probability of any certain event is 1. For an instance, the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow from the east is 1, the probability that the sun will set in the west in this evening is likewise 1. The probability of not seeing the sun in the night is also 1. The probability of getting $H$ or $T$ is also 1. The probability of getting even or odd in an experiment of throwing dice is also 1. These are all certain events.

\textbf{Impossible Events}: An event which will not occur, that means which is not possible to occur in an experiment is called an impossible event. The probability of an impossible event is zero. For instance, the probability that tomorrow the sun will rise in the west or set in the east, is zero. The probability of seeing the sun in the night is zero too. Similarly, the probability of getting a 7 in throwing a dice is also zero. All these events mentioned here are impossible events.

\textbf{Example 3.} In a bag there are 4 red, 5 white and 6 black balls. A ball is chosen at random. What is the probability that the ball will be 1) red, 2) white and 3) black?

Solution: Total number of balls in the bag is 15. If a ball is chosen randomly, any of the 15 balls may be drawn. Therefore total number of outcomes = 15.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose the event of drawing a red ball is $R$. There are 4 red balls in the bag. So the number of favourable cases for this event = 4.
    
    \[
    \therefore P(R) = \frac{\text{number of events favourable to draw a red ball}}{\text{total number of outcomes}} = \frac{4}{15}.
    \]
    
    \item Suppose the event of drawing a white ball is $W$. There are 5 white balls in the bag. So the number of favourable cases for this event = 5.
    
    \[
    \therefore P(W) = \frac{\text{number of events favourable to draw a white ball}}{\text{total number of outcomes}} = \frac{5}{15} = \frac{1}{3}.
    \]
    
    \item Suppose the event of drawing a black ball is $B$. There are 6 black balls in the bag. So number of favourable cases for the event = 6.
    
    \[
    \therefore P(B) = \frac{\text{number of events favourable to draw a black ball}}{\text{total number of outcomes}} = \frac{6}{15} = \frac{2}{5}.
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\part{Data-Based Probability}

\section*{Data Based Probability}

In the logical approach to determining probabilities, the outcomes are required to be equally likely. However, in reality the outcomes are not equally likely in all cases. Moreover, in many situations, it is not possible to apply the logical approach. For example, today's weather forecast says that the probability of raining today is 30\%, the probability of Brazil winning the world football cup is 40\%, the probability of Bangladesh winning the Asia cup is 60\%. These statements are based on statistics or data of past records and this is the concept of data-based probability.

Suppose, a coin is tossed 1000 times which resulted in head 523 times. So the relative frequency of getting head is $\frac{523}{1000} = 0.523$. Suppose, a coin is tossed 2000 times which resulted in head 1030 times. So the relative frequency of $H$ in 2000 times is $\frac{1030}{2000} = 0.515$. From this we can understand that, the more times an experiment (tossing of a coin) is done, the closer the relative frequency will be to the probability of getting a head in a single tossing of the coin. This is called data based probability.

\textbf{Example 4.} According to meteorological records, it rained on 21 days in the month of July last year. What is the probability that it will rain on fourth of July this year?

Solution: As out of the 31 days in the month of July, it rained on total 21 days last year, the probability of raining on a particular day of July this year is $\frac{21}{31}$. Therefore the probability of raining on fourth of July is $\frac{21}{31}$.

\textbf{Example 5.} In a survey among the readers of newspapers, it was found that 65 persons read the Prothom Alo, 40 persons read the Bhorer Kagoj, 45 read the Janakantho, 52 read the Jugantor. If one person is chosen at random from these readers, what is the probability that the person reads the Jugantor? What is the probability that the person does not read the Prothom Alo?

Solution: Here, the total number of readers is $(65 + 40 + 45 + 52) = 202$.

The number of persons reading the Jugantor is 52. So, the probability that the chosen person reads the Jugantor is $\frac{52}{202}$.

65 persons read the Prothom Alo. Number of persons who do not read the Prothom Alo is $(202 - 65) = 137$. So, the probability that the person does not read the Prothom Alo is = $\frac{137}{202}$.

\part{Probability Using Sample Space and Probability Trees}

\section*{Determination of Probability using Sample Space and Probability Tree}

It has been already mentioned that the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the sample space. Often the sample space of an experiment is quite large. In such cases, the counting of all sample points and the formation of the sample space may be cumbersome and can even lead to mistakes. In such cases we may build the sample space by using the probability tree, and use it to find the probability of various events.

\textbf{Example 6.} Suppose, two unbiased coins are tossed together. Form the sample space, find the probability of getting $H$ on first coin and $T$ on second coin.

Solution: The tossing of two coins may be treated as a two step process. In the first step, one of the coins is tossed which may result in either $H$ or $T$. In the second step, the other coin is tossed which may, likewise, result in either $H$ or $T$. All possible outcomes of this experiment may be exhibited in the form of a probability tree diagram as follows:

Image description: A probability tree diagram for tossing two coins, with the first toss branching into $H$ or $T$, each followed by a second toss branching into $H$ or $T$, resulting in outcomes $HH$, $HT$, $TH$, and $TT$.

So the sample points are: $HH, HT, TH, TT$. So the sample space will be $\{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$. Here the number of sample points is 4 and the probability of observing a sample point is $\frac{1}{4}$. So the probability of getting $H$ on the first coin and the probability of getting $T$ on the second coin will be, $P(HT) = \frac{1}{4}$.

\textbf{Example 7.} Suppose, an unbiased coin is tossed thrice. Show the sample space using a probability tree and find the probabilities of the each of the following events. 1) getting just one tail, 2) getting head in all three tossings, 3) getting at least one tail.

Solution: The tossing of the coin three times may be treated as a three step process. In each toss the number of possible outcomes are two, which are $H$ or $T$. The total result is shown below, using probability tree:

Image description: A probability tree diagram for tossing a coin three times, starting with a first toss branching into $H$ or $T$, each followed by a second toss branching into $H$ or $T$, and each of those followed by a third toss branching into $H$ or $T$, resulting in outcomes $HHH$, $HHT$, $HTH$, $HTT$, $THH$, $THT$, $TTH$, $TTT$.

The sample space is: $\{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}$.

Here the total number of sample points is 8 and the probability of any one of these outcomes is $\frac{1}{8}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The sample points (outcomes) containing just one tail are $\{THH, HHT, HTH\} = 3$.
    
    \[
    \therefore P(1T) = \frac{3}{8} \text{ (as possibility of occurring every sample point is } \frac{1}{8}\text{)}
    \]
    
    \item Getting head $(H)$ in all three tossings is the outcome $\{HHH\} = 1$ outcome.
    
    \[
    \therefore P(HHH) = \frac{1}{8}
    \]
    
    \item The sample points containing at least one tail $(T)$ are all except $HHH$ which means $\{HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT\} = 7$.
    
    \[
    \therefore P[\text{at least } 1T] = \frac{7}{8}
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example 8.} An unbiased dice and an unbiased coin are thrown and tossed once. Form the probability tree and write down the sample space. Find the probability of getting 5 on the dice and $H$ on the coin.

Solution: The throwing of a single dice and the tossing of a single coin may be treated as a two step process. In the first step, 6 possible outcomes are possible which are $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. In the second step, the tossing of the coin will result in 2 possible outcomes which are $H$ or $T$. The corresponding probability tree is shown below:

Image description: A probability tree diagram for throwing a dice and tossing a coin, with the dice throw branching into outcomes $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$, each followed by a coin toss branching into $H$ or $T$, resulting in outcomes $1H, 1T, 2H, 2T, 3H, 3T, 4H, 4T, 5H, 5T, 6H, 6T$.

Therefore, the sample space will be: $\{1H, 1T, 2H, 2T, 3H, 3T, 4H, 4T, 5H, 5T, 6H, 6T\}$.

Here the total number of sample points is 12. $\therefore$ The probability of getting 5 on the dice and $H$ on the coin is $P(5H) = \frac{1}{12}$.

\part{Complex Probability Problems}

\textbf{Example 9.} The probability that a person will travel from Dhaka to Khulna by bus is $\frac{2}{5}$ and that he will travel from Khulna to Rajshahi by train is $\frac{5}{8}$. Use a probability tree to determine the probability that the person will travel to Khulna by bus and will subsequently travel to Rajshahi not by train.

Solution: The probability tree will be

Image description: A probability tree diagram for travel from Dhaka to Khulna and Khulna to Rajshahi, with the first step branching into bus ($\frac{2}{5}$) or not bus ($\frac{3}{5}$), and each followed by train ($\frac{5}{8}$) or not train ($\frac{3}{8}$) for the second step, showing probabilities for each path.

Therefore, the probability that the person will travel from Dhaka to Khulna by bus and then from Khulna to Rajshahi not by train is

\[
P[\text{Khulna by bus, Rajshahi not by train}] = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{6}{40} = \frac{3}{20}
\]
