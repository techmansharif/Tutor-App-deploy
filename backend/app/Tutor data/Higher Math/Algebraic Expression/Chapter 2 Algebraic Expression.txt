% Title and Introduction
\section*{Chapter 2: Algebraic Expressions}

We are familiar with various types of algebraic expressions. When one or more numbers and symbols representing numbers are combined meaningfully by one or more of $+, -, \times, \div$, power or rational sign, a new symbol representing numbers is created. It is called an algebraic expression or in brief expression. For example, each of $2x$, $2x+3ay$, $6x+4y^2+a+\sqrt{z}$ etc., is an algebraic expression.

At the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item explain the concept of a polynomial;
    \item explain with example the concept of a polynomial with one variable;
    \item explain multiplication and division of polynomials;
    \item explain the remainder theorem and the factor theorem and apply to factorize a polynomial;
    \item explain homogeneous expressions, symmetric expressions and cyclic expressions;
    \item factorize homogeneous expression, symmetric expressions and cyclic expression;
    \item resolve rational fractions into partial fractions.
\end{itemize}

% Part 1: Polynomial Concepts
\part{Polynomial Concepts}

% Variable, Constant and Polynomial
\subsection*{Variable, Constant and Polynomial}
In any discussion, a literal symbol representing a number may be a variable or a constant. If such a symbol denotes any unscheduled element of the number set consisting of more than one element, we call the symbol a variable and the set is called the domain. If the symbol denotes a definite number, it is called a constant. In any discussion, a variable can take any value from its domain, but the value of a constant remains fixed throughout. A polynomial is a special type of algebraic expression. In a polynomial, there are one or more terms, and each term is a product of a constant and a non-negative integral power of one or more variables.

% Polynomial of One Variable
\subsection*{Polynomial of One Variable}
Let $x$ be a variable. Then, (i) $a$, (ii) $ax+b$, (iii) $ax^2+bx+c$, (iv) $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ are polynomials of the variable $x$, where $a, b, c, d$ are fixed number constants. Generally, the terms of a polynomial of the variable $x$ have the form $cx^p$, where $c$ (independent of $x$) is a fixed number (which may be zero) and $p$ is a non-negative integer. If $p$ is zero, the term becomes $c$, and if $c$ is zero, the term is suppressed in the polynomial. $c$ is called the coefficient of $x^p$ in the term $cx^p$, and $p$ is called the degree of the term. The largest of the degrees of the terms appearing in a polynomial is called the degree of the polynomial. The term having the largest degree is called the leading term, and the coefficient of the term having the largest degree is called the leading coefficient; the term with degree 0, that is, the term independent of variable $x$, is called the constant term. For example, $2x^6-3x^5-x^4+2x-5$ is a polynomial of the variable $x$, its degree is 6, its leading term is $2x^6$, leading coefficient is 2, and constant is $-5$. If $a \neq 0$, the aforesaid (i) degree of the polynomial is 0, (ii) degree of the polynomial is 1, (iii) degree of the polynomial is 2, and (iv) degree of polynomial is 3. Any non-zero constant ($a \neq 0$) is a 0-degree polynomial of the variable (consider $a=ax^0$). The number 0 is considered a zero-polynomial, and the degree of a zero-polynomial is considered undefined.

A polynomial of the variable $x$ is usually arranged in descending order of the degrees of its terms (the leading term appearing first and the constant term appearing last). This arrangement of a polynomial is called its standard form. For convenience of use, polynomials of the variable $x$ are denoted by symbols like $P(x)$, $Q(x)$, etc. For example, $P(x)=2x^2+7x+5$. Such symbol $P(x)$ indicates that the values of a polynomial depend on the values of $x$. If a specific number $a$ is substituted for $x$ in the polynomial, the value of the polynomial for that value of $x$ is denoted by $P(a)$.

\textbf{Example 1.} If $P(x)=3x^3+2x^2-7x+8$, then find the value of $P(2)$, $P(-2)$, and $P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$.

solution: Replacing $x$ successively with $2$, $-2$, $\frac{1}{2}$, we get:
\begin{align*}
P(2) &= 3(2^3) + 2(2^2) - 7(2) + 8 = 26, \\
P(-2) &= 3(-2^3) + 2(-2^2) - 7(-2) + 8 = 6, \\
P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) &= 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 7\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 8 = \frac{43}{8}.
\end{align*}

% Polynomials of Two Variables
\subsection*{Polynomials of Two Variables}
The polynomials listed below are of the variables $x$ and $y$:
\begin{align*}
2x + 3y - 1, \\
x^2 - 4xy + y^2 - 5x + 7y + 1, \\
8x^3 + y^3 + 10x^2 y + 6xy^2 - 6x + 2.
\end{align*}
The terms of such polynomials have the form $cx^p y^q$, where $c$ is a definite number (constant) and $p, q$ are non-negative integers. In the term $cx^p y^q$, the coefficient of $x^p y^q$ is $c$, and the degree of the term is $p+q$. In such a polynomial, the largest of the degrees of the terms is called the degree of the polynomial. Such polynomials are denoted by $P(x, y)$. For example, the polynomial $P(x, y) = 8x^3 + y^3 - 4x^2 + 7xy + 2y - 5$ has degree 3, and $P(1,0) = 8 - 4 - 5 = -1$.

% Polynomial of Three Variables
\subsection*{Polynomial of Three Variables}
The terms of a polynomial of the variables $x, y, z$ have the form $cx^p y^q z^r$, where $c$ (constant) is the coefficient of the term and $p, q, r$ are non-negative integers; $p+q+r$ is the degree of this term, and the largest of the degrees in the polynomial is called the degree of the polynomial. Such a polynomial is denoted by the symbol $P(x, y, z)$. For example, the polynomial $P(x, y, z) = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz$ has degree 3, and $P(1,1,-2) = 1 + 1 - 8 + 6 = 0$.

% Part 2: Polynomial Operations
\part{Polynomial Operations}

% Multiplication and Division of Polynomial
\subsection*{Multiplication and Division of Polynomial}
Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two polynomials always result in a polynomial, but division of a polynomial may or may not be a polynomial. For example, if we divide $x$ by $x^3$, taking the answer as $x^{-2}$, it is not a polynomial, but if we take $x$ as a remainder and result as 0, it is a polynomial.

\textbf{Example 2.} What is the result of the multiplication of $(x^2+2)$ and $(x+1)$?

solution: The result of multiplication of $(x^2+2)$ and $(x+1)$ is $(x^2+2)(x+1) = x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 2$, which is a polynomial with degree $2+1=3$ and leading coefficient $1 \times 1 = 1$.

\textbf{Example 3.} What is the quotient when $(x^2+1)(x-6)$ is divided by $2x^2+3$?

solution: Dividend $P(x) = (x^2+1)(x-6) = x^3 - 6x^2 + x - 6$ with degree 3 and leading coefficient 1. Divisor $Q(x) = 2x^2 + 3$ with degree 2 and leading coefficient 2. Dividing $P(x)$ by $Q(x)$, we get quotient $F(x) = \frac{1}{2}x - 3$ and remainder $R(x) = -\frac{x}{2} + 3$. Hence, quotient $F(x)$ is a polynomial with degree $3-2=1$ and leading coefficient $\frac{1}{2}$.

Note: The following rules hold true for multiplication and division of two polynomials:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Multiplication of polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ of variable $x$ yields a polynomial whose degree = Degree of $P(x)$ + Degree of $Q(x)$, leading coefficient = Leading coefficient of $P(x) \times$ Leading coefficient of $Q(x)$.
    \item If we divide polynomial $P(x)$ by $Q(x)$ of variable $x$ and the quotient $R(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ is also a polynomial, then degree of $R(x)$ = Degree of $P(x)$ - Degree of $Q(x)$, and leading coefficient = $\frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)}$.
\end{enumerate}

% Division Algorithm
\subsection*{Division Algorithm}
If both $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials of the variable $x$ and if the degree of $Q(x) \leq$ degree of $P(x)$, we can divide $P(x)$ by $Q(x)$ in the usual manner and obtain a quotient $F(x)$ and a remainder $R(x)$, where:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Both $F(x)$ and $R(x)$ are polynomials of the variable $x$.
    \item Degree of $F(x)$ = degree of $P(x)$ - degree of $Q(x)$.
    \item Either $R(x) = 0$ or degree of $R(x) < $ degree of $Q(x)$.
    \item $P(x) = F(x)Q(x) + R(x)$ holds for all $x$.
\end{enumerate}

% Equality Rule of Polynomials
\subsection*{Equality Rule of Polynomials}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $ax + b = px + q$ holds for all $x$, putting $x=0$ and $x=1$, we get respectively $b=q$ and $a+b=p+q$, from whence it is found $a=p$, $b=q$.
    \item If $ax^2 + bx + c = px^2 + qx + r$ holds for all $x$, putting $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$, we get respectively $c=r$, $a+b+c=p+q+r$, and $a-b+c=p-q+r$, from whence it is found that $a=p$, $b=q$, $c=r$.
    \item In general, if $a_0 x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + a_2 x^{n-2} + \cdots + a_{n-1} x + a_n = p_0 x^n + p_1 x^{n-1} + p_2 x^{n-2} + \cdots + p_{n-1} x + p_n$ holds for all $x$, then $a_0 = p_0$, $a_1 = p_1$, $\dots$, $a_{n-1} = p_{n-1}$, $a_n = p_n$, i.e., the coefficients of $x$ with the same power are equal on both sides of an equal sign.
\end{enumerate}

Remarks: It is convenient to denote the coefficients of a polynomial of degree $n$ by $a_0$, $a_1$, etc.

% Identity
\subsection*{Identity}
If two polynomials $P(x)$, $Q(x)$ are equal for all $x$, their equality is called the identity of the polynomials; sometimes this is indicated by writing $P(x) \equiv Q(x)$. In this case, the two polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are the same. The sign $\equiv$ is called the identity sign. Generally, the equality of two algebraic expressions is called an identity if the domain of any variable of the two expressions is the same and for the values included in the domain of the variables, the values of the two expressions are equal. For example, $x(x+2) = x^2 + 2x$, $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$ are identities.

% Remainder and Factor Theorems
\subsection*{Remainder and Factor Theorems}
In this section, we shall deal with polynomials of one variable only.

\textbf{Example 4.} If $P(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6$, divide $P(x)$ by $(x-4)$ and show that the remainder is equal to $P(4)$.

solution: Divide $P(x)$ by $(x-4)$:
\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
x-4 & x^2 & -5x & +6 \\
& x^2 & -4x & \\
\hline
& & -x & +6 \\
& & -x & +4 \\
\hline
& & & 2 \\
\end{array}
\]
The remainder is 2. Since $P(4) = 4^2 - 5(4) + 6 = 2$, the remainder equals $P(4)$.

\textbf{Example 5.} If $P(x) = ax^3 + bx + c$, divide $P(x)$ by $x-m$ and show that the remainder is equal to $P(m)$.

solution: Divide $P(x)$ by $x-m$:
\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
x-m & ax^3 & +0x^2 & +bx & +c \\
& ax^3 & -amx^2 & & \\
\hline
& & amx^2 & +bx & +c \\
& & amx^2 & -am^2x & \\
\hline
& & & (am^2 + b)x & +c \\
& & & (am^2 + b)x & -(am^2 + b)m \\
\hline
& & & & am^3 + bm + c \\
\end{array}
\]
The remainder is $am^3 + bm + c$. Since $P(m) = am^3 + bm + c$, the remainder equals $P(m)$.

These two examples suggest the following propositions.

\textbf{Proposition 1 (Remainder Theorem).} If $P(x)$ is a polynomial of positive degree and $a$ is any definite number, the remainder of the division of $P(x)$ by $x-a$ will be $P(a)$.

\textbf{Proof:} If we divide $P(x)$ by $x-a$, the remainder is either 0 or a non-zero constant. Suppose the remainder is $R$ and the quotient is $Q(x)$, then by the law of division, for all $x$:
\[
P(x) = (x-a)Q(x) + R.
\]
Putting $x=a$, we get $P(a) = 0 \cdot Q(a) + R = R$. Therefore, the remainder of $P(x)$ upon division by $x-a$ is $P(a)$.

\textbf{Example 6.} Divide $P(x) = x^3 - 8x^2 + 6x + 60$ by $x+2$ and find the remainder.

solution: Since $x+2 = x-(-2)$, remainder = $P(-2) = (-2)^3 - 8(-2)^2 + 6(-2) + 60 = 8$.

\textbf{Proposition 2.} If $P(x)$ is a polynomial of positive degree and $a \neq 0$, the remainder of the division of $P(x)$ by $ax+b$ will be $P\left(-\frac{b}{a}\right)$.

\textbf{Example 7.} Divide $P(x) = 36x^2 - 8x + 5$ by $(2x-1)$ and find the remainder.

solution: The remainder is $P\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 36\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 5 = 9 - 4 + 5 = 10$.

\textbf{Example 8.} If dividing $P(x) = 5x^3 + 6x^2 - ax + 6$ by $x-2$ results in the remainder 6, then find the value of $a$.

solution: Dividing $P(x)$ by $x-2$, remainder = $P(2) = 5(2^3) + 6(2^2) - a(2) + 6 = 70 - 2a$. Given $70 - 2a = 6$, so $2a = 64 \implies a = 32$.

\textbf{Example 9.} If $P(x) = x^3 + 5x^2 + 6x + 8$ yields the same remainder upon division by $x-a$ and $x-b$ where $a \neq b$, show that $a^2 + b^2 + ab + 5a + 5b + 6 = 0$.

solution: Remainder for $x-a$ is $P(a) = a^3 + 5a^2 + 6a + 8$, and for $x-b$ is $P(b) = b^3 + 5b^2 + 6b + 8$. Given $P(a) = P(b)$:
\[
a^3 - b^3 + 5(a^2 - b^2) + 6(a - b) = 0 \implies (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2 + 5a + 5b + 6) = 0.
\]
Since $a \neq b$, $a^2 + b^2 + ab + 5a + 5b + 6 = 0$.

\textbf{Proposition 3 (Factor Theorem).} If $P(x)$ is a polynomial of positive degree and if $P(a) = 0$, then $x-a$ is a factor of $P(x)$.

\textbf{Proof:} The remainder of $P(x)$ upon division by $x-a$ is $P(a) = 0$. Thus, $P(x)$ is divisible by $x-a$, so $x-a$ is a factor of $P(x)$.

% Converse of Factor Theorem
\subsection*{Converse of Factor Theorem}
\textbf{Proposition 4.} If $x-a$ is a factor of the polynomial $P(x)$, show that $P(a) = 0$.

\textbf{Proof:} Since $x-a$ is a factor of $P(x)$, there exists a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x) = (x-a)Q(x)$. Putting $x=a$, we get $P(a) = (a-a)Q(a) = 0$.

\textbf{Example 10.} Show that $x-1$ will be a factor of $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, if and only if $a + b + c + d = 0$.

solution: Suppose $a + b + c + d = 0$. Then $P(1) = a + b + c + d = 0$, so $x-1$ is a factor by the factor theorem. Conversely, if $x-1$ is a factor, then $P(1) = 0 \implies a + b + c + d = 0$.

Remarks: In general, $x-1$ will be a factor of a polynomial of positive degree if and only if the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial is 0.

\textbf{Example 11.} Suppose $P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, $a \neq 0$, $d \neq 0$; suppose $x-r$ is a factor of $P(x)$, show that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $r$ is an integer, $r$ will be a factor of the constant term.
    \item If $r = \frac{p}{q}$ is a rational number in its reduced form, $p$ will be a factor of $d$, and $q$ will be a factor of $a$.
\end{enumerate}

solution: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Since $x-r$ is a factor, $P(r) = ar^3 + br^2 + cr + d = 0 \implies (ar^2 + br + c)r = -d$. Since $r$ and $d$ are integers, $r$ is a factor of $d$.
    \item $P\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = a\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^3 + b\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^2 + c\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) + d = 0 \implies ap^3 + bp^2 q + cpq^2 + dq^3 = 0$. Thus, $(ap^2 + bpq + cq^2)p = -dq^3$ and $(bp^2 + cpq + dq^2)q = -ap^3$. Since $p$ and $q$ are coprime, $p$ is a factor of $d$, and $q$ is a factor of $a$.
\end{enumerate}

Note: To determine the factors of a polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients, test $P(r)$ and $P\left(\frac{r}{s}\right)$ where $r$ is a factor of the constant term and $s$ is a factor of the leading coefficient.

\textbf{Example 12.} Resolve the polynomial $P(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6$ into factors.

solution: Constant term is $-6$, leading coefficient is 1. Possible $r$: $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6$.
\begin{align*}
P(1) &= 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0 \implies x-1 \text{ is a factor}, \\
P(-1) &= -1 - 6 - 11 - 6 \neq 0, \\
P(2) &= 8 - 24 + 22 - 6 = 0 \implies x-2 \text{ is a factor}, \\
P(3) &= 27 - 54 + 33 - 6 = 0 \implies x-3 \text{ is a factor}.
\end{align*}
Since $P(x)$ is degree 3, $P(x) = k(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$. Equating leading coefficients, $k=1$. Thus, $P(x) = (x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$.

\textbf{Example 13.} Resolve into factors: $18x^3 + 15x^2 - x - 2$.

solution: Let $P(x) = 18x^3 + 15x^2 - x - 2$. Constant term $-2$, factors: $\{ \pm 1, \pm 2 \}$. Leading coefficient 18, factors: $\{ \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6, \pm 9, \pm 18 \}$. Test $P\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)$:
\[
P\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 18\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) + 15\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + \frac{1}{2} - 2 = 0 \implies 2x+1 \text{ is a factor}.
\]
Rearrange:
\[
P(x) = (2x+1)(9x^2 + 3x - 2), \quad 9x^2 + 3x - 2 = (3x+2)(3x-1).
\]
Thus, $P(x) = (2x+1)(3x+2)(3x-1)$.

\textbf{Example 14.} Resolve $-3x^2 - 2xy + 8y^2 + 11x - 8y - 6$ into factors.

solution: For $x$ terms: $-3x^2 + 11x - 6 = (-3x + 2)(x - 3)$. For $y$ terms: $8y^2 - 8y - 6 = (4y + 2)(2y - 3)$. Combining factors, ensuring matching constants, yields factors $(-3x + 4y + 2)(x + 2y - 3)$. Verify coefficient of $xy$: $-3 \cdot 2 + 4 \cdot 1 = -2$.

% Part 3: Homogeneous, Symmetric, and Cyclic Expressions
\part{Homogeneous, Symmetric, and Cyclic Expressions}

% Homogeneous, Symmetric and Cyclic Expressions
\subsection*{Homogeneous, Symmetric and Cyclic Expressions}

\textbf{Homogeneous Polynomial:} If each term of a polynomial has the same degree, it is called a homogeneous polynomial. The expression $x^2 + 2xy + 5y^2$ is a homogeneous polynomial of variables $x, y$ with degree 2. The expression $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in $x, y$. The expression $2x^2 y + y^2 z + 9z^2 x - 5xyz$ is a homogeneous polynomial of variables $x, y, z$ with degree 3.

\textbf{Symmetric Expression:} An expression with more than one variable, which remains unchanged when any two of its variables are interchanged, is called a symmetric expression. For example, $a + b + c$ and $ab + bc + ca$ are symmetric in $a, b, c$. Similarly, $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + yz + zx$ is symmetric in $x, y, z$. But $2x^2 + 5xy + 6y^2$ is not symmetric in $x, y$.

\textbf{Cyclic Expression:} An expression with three variables, which remains unchanged when the first variable is replaced by the second, the second by the third, and the third by the first, is called a cyclically symmetric expression.

Image description: A diagram with three variables $x, y, z$ connected by arrows in a cycle ($x \to y \to z \to x$), illustrating cyclic symmetry.

The expression $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + yz + zx$ is cyclic in $x, y, z$. Similarly, $x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x$ is cyclic. But $x^2 - y^2 + z^2$ is not cyclic.

Clearly, every symmetric expression in three variables is cyclic. But not every cyclic expression is symmetric. For example, $x^2(y-z) + y^2(z-x) + z^2(x-y)$ is cyclic but not symmetric.

Observation: For convenience, expressions in $x, y$ are denoted by $F(x, y)$, and in $x, y, z$ by $F(x, y, z)$.

% Resolve into Factors of Cyclic Polynomials
\subsection*{Resolve into Factors of Cyclic Polynomials}
There is no hard and fast rule for factorizing polynomials. Often a factor can be found by suitably rearranging terms. Sometimes, assuming the expression as a polynomial in one variable, we determine factors using the factor theorem and cyclic/symmetric properties. Note:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $(a-b)$ is a factor of a cyclic polynomial in $a, b, c$, then $(b-c)$ and $(c-a)$ are also factors.
    \item $k(a+b+c)$ and $k(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + m(ab + bc + ca)$ are homogeneous and cyclic polynomials of degrees 1 and 2, where $k, m$ are constants.
    \item If two polynomials are equal for all variable values, their corresponding term coefficients are equal.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example 15.} Resolve into factors $bc(b-c) + ca(c-a) + ab(a-b)$.

solution: First method:
\[
bc(b-c) + ca(c-a) + ab(a-b) = (b-c)(c-a)(b-a) = -(a-b)(b-c)(c-a).
\]
Second method: As a polynomial $P(a)$, $P(b) = 0 \implies (a-b)$ is a factor. Similarly, $(b-c)$, $(c-a)$ are factors. Since the expression is cyclic and degree 3, the remaining factor is a constant $k$. Set $k(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)$, and for $a=0$, $b=1$, $c=2$, we get $k=-1$. Thus:
\[
bc(b-c) + ca(c-a) + ab(a-b) = -(a-b)(b-c)(c-a).
\]

\textbf{Example 16.} Resolve into factor $a^3(b-c) + b^3(c-a) + c^3(a-b)$.

solution: As a polynomial $P(a)$, $P(b) = 0 \implies (a-b)$ is a factor. Similarly, $(b-c)$, $(c-a)$ are factors. The expression is cyclic, degree 4, so the remaining factor is degree 1, $k(a+b+c)$. Set:
\[
a^3(b-c) + b^3(c-a) + c^3(a-b) = k(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)(a+b+c).
\]
For $a=0$, $b=1$, $c=2$, $k=-1$. Thus:
\[
a^3(b-c) + b^3(c-a) + c^3(a-b) = -(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)(a+b+c).
\]

\textbf{Example 17.} Factorize $(b+c)(c+a)(a+b) + abc$.

solution: As $P(a)$, $P(-b-c) = 0 \implies (a+b+c)$ is a factor. The expression is cyclic, degree 3, so the remaining factor is degree 2, $k(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + m(bc + ca + ab)$. Set:
\[
(b+c)(c+a)(a+b) + abc = (a+b+c)[k(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + m(bc + ca + ab)].
\]
For $a=0$, $b=0$, $c=1$, $k=0$; for $a=1$, $b=1$, $c=0$, $m=1$. Thus:
\[
(b+c)(c+a)(a+b) + abc = (a+b+c)(bc + ca + ab).
\]

% An Important Algebraic Formula
\subsection*{An Important Algebraic Formula}
For all $a, b, c$:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca).
\]

\textbf{Proof:} First method:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca).
\]
Second method: As $P(a)$, $P(-b-c) = 0 \implies (a+b+c)$ is a factor. The expression is degree 3, so the other factor is $k(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + m(ab + bc + ca)$. For $a=1$, $b=0$, $c=0$, $k=1$; for $a=1$, $b=1$, $c=0$, $m=-1$. Thus:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca).
\]

\textbf{Corollary 1.} 
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = \frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)\{(a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2\}.
\]

\textbf{Proof:}
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca = \frac{1}{2}\{(a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2 + (c-a)^2\}.
\]

\textbf{Corollary 2.} If $a + b + c = 0$, then $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$.

\textbf{Corollary 3.} If $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$, then $a + b + c = 0$ or $a = b = c$.

\textbf{Example 18.} Factorize $(a-b)^3 + (b-c)^3 + (c-a)^3$.

solution: Let $A = a-b$, $B = b-c$, $C = c-a$. Then $A + B + C = 0$, so $A^3 + B^3 + C^3 = 3ABC$. Thus:
\[
(a-b)^3 + (b-c)^3 + (c-a)^3 = 3(a-b)(b-c)(c-a).
\]

% Rational Fractions
\subsection*{Rational Fractions}
A fraction formed with a polynomial as denominator and a polynomial as numerator is called a rational fraction. For example, $\frac{x}{(x-a)(x-b)}$ and $\frac{a^2 + a + 1}{(a-b)(a-c)}$ are rational fractions.

\textbf{Example 19.} Simplify: $\frac{a}{(a-b)(a-c)} + \frac{b}{(b-c)(b-a)} + \frac{c}{(c-a)(c-b)}$.

solution:
\[
\frac{a}{(a-b)(a-c)} + \frac{b}{(b-c)(b-a)} + \frac{c}{(c-a)(c-b)} = \frac{a(b-c) + b(c-a) + c(a-b)}{-(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)} = 0.
\]

\textbf{Example 20.} Simplify: $\frac{a^2 - (b-c)^2}{(a+c)^2 - b^2} + \frac{b^2 - (c-a)^2}{(a+b)^2 - c^2} + \frac{c^2 - (a-b)^2}{(b+c)^2 - a^2}$.

solution: Each term simplifies to $\frac{a+b-c}{a+b+c}$, $\frac{b+c-a}{a+b+c}$, $\frac{c+a-b}{a+b+c}$. Their sum is:
\[
\frac{a + b - c + b + c - a + c + a - b}{a + b + c} = 1.
\]

\textbf{Example 21.} Simplify: $\frac{(ax + 1)^2}{(x-y)(z-x)} + \frac{(ay + 1)^2}{(x-y)(y-z)} + \frac{(az + 1)^2}{(y-z)(z-x)}$.

solution: The numerator simplifies to $1 + a^2(y-z)(z-x)(x-y)$, and the denominator is $(x-y)(y-z)(z-x)$. Thus, the expression equals $1 + a^2$.

\textbf{Example 22.} Simplify: $\frac{1}{x+a} + \frac{2x}{x^2 + a^2} + \frac{4x^3}{x^4 + a^4} + \frac{8x^7}{a^8 - x^8}$.

solution: Combine terms:
\[
\frac{4x^3}{x^4 + a^4} + \frac{8x^7}{(x^4 + a^4)(a^4 - x^4)} = \frac{4x^3}{a^4 - x^4},
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + a^2} + \frac{4x^3}{a^4 - x^4} = \frac{2x}{a^2 - x^2},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{x + a} + \frac{2x}{a^2 - x^2} = \frac{1}{a - x}.
\]

% Partial Fractions
\subsection*{Partial Fractions}
If a given fraction is expressed as a sum of two or more fractions, then each of the latter fractions is said to be a partial fraction of the given fraction. For example:
\[
\frac{3x - 8}{x^2 - 5x + 6} = \frac{2}{x - 2} + \frac{1}{x - 3}.
\]
If both $N(x)$ and $D(x)$ are polynomials of the variable $x$ and if the degree of numerator $N(x)$ is less than the denominator $D(x)$, the fraction is called a proper fraction. If the degree of $N(x)$ is greater than or equal to that of $D(x)$, the fraction is called an improper fraction.

% The Denominator is a Product of Distinct Linear Factors
\subsection*{The Denominator is a Product of Distinct Linear Factors}

\textbf{Example 23.} Resolve into partial fraction $\frac{5x - 7}{(x-1)(x-2)}$.

solution: Let $\frac{5x - 7}{(x-1)(x-2)} \equiv \frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{B}{x-2}$. Multiply by $(x-1)(x-2)$:
\[
5x - 7 = A(x-2) + B(x-1).
\]
For $x=1$, $-2 = -A \implies A = 2$. For $x=2$, $3 = B$. Thus:
\[
\frac{5x - 7}{(x-1)(x-2)} = \frac{2}{x-1} + \frac{3}{x-2}.
\]

\textbf{Example 24.} Express $\frac{x + 5}{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)}$ into partial fraction.

solution: Let $\frac{x + 5}{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)} \equiv \frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{B}{x-2} + \frac{C}{x-3}$. Multiply by $(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$:
\[
x + 5 = A(x-2)(x-3) + B(x-1)(x-3) + C(x-1)(x-2).
\]
For $x=1$, $6 = 2A \implies A = 3$. For $x=2$, $7 = -B \implies B = -7$. For $x=3$, $8 = 2C \implies C = 4$. Thus:
\[
\frac{x + 5}{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)} = \frac{3}{x-1} - \frac{7}{x-2} + \frac{4}{x-3}.
\]

% Degree of Numerator Greater or Equal to Denominator
\subsection*{Degree of Numerator Greater or Equal to Denominator}

\textbf{Example 25.} Express $\frac{(x-1)(x-5)}{(x-2)(x-4)}$ into partial fraction.

solution: Divide numerator by denominator, quotient is 1, remainder is $3x - 3$. Let:
\[
\frac{(x-1)(x-5)}{(x-2)(x-4)} = 1 + \frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x-4}.
\]
Multiply by $(x-2)(x-4)$:
\[
(x-1)(x-5) = (x-2)(x-4) + A(x-4) + B(x-2).
\]
For $x=2$, $-3 = -2A \implies A = \frac{3}{2}$. For $x=4$, $-3 = 2B \implies B = -\frac{3}{2}$. Thus:
\[
\frac{(x-1)(x-5)}{(x-2)(x-4)} = 1 + \frac{3}{2(x-2)} - \frac{3}{2(x-4)}.
\]

\textbf{Example 26.} Express $\frac{2x^3}{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)}$ into partial fraction.

solution: Divide numerator by denominator, quotient is 2. Let:
\[
\frac{2x^3}{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)} = 2 + \frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{B}{x-2} + \frac{C}{x-3}.
\]
Multiply by $(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)$:
\[
2x^3 = 2(x-1)(x-2)(x-3) + A(x-2)(x-3) + B(x-1)(x-3) + C(x-1)(x-2).
\]
For $x=1$, $2 = 2A \implies A = 1$. For $x=2$, $16 = -B \implies B = -16$. For $x=3$, $54 = 2C \implies C = 27$. Thus:
\[
\frac{2x^3}{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)} = 2 + \frac{1}{x-1} - \frac{16}{x-2} + \frac{27}{x-3}.
\]

% Denominator with Repeated Linear Factors
\subsection*{Denominator with Repeated Linear Factors}

\textbf{Example 27.} Express $\frac{x}{(x-1)^2(x-2)}$ as partial fraction.

solution: Let $\frac{x}{(x-1)^2(x-2)} \equiv \frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{B}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{C}{x-2}$. Multiply by $(x-1)^2(x-2)$:
\[
x = A(x-1)(x-2) + B(x-2) + C(x-1)^2.
\]
For $x=1$, $1 = -B \implies B = -1$. For $x=2$, $2 = C \implies C = 2$. Equate $x^2$ coefficients: $0 = A + C \implies A = -2$. Thus:
\[
\frac{x}{(x-1)^2(x-2)} = -\frac{2}{x-1} - \frac{1}{(x-1)^2} + \frac{2}{x-2}.
\]

% Denominator with Linear and Quadratic Factors
\subsection*{Denominator with Linear and Quadratic Factors}

\textbf{Example 28.} Express $\frac{x}{(x-1)(x^2 + 4)}$ as partial fraction.

solution: Let $\frac{x}{(x-1)(x^2 + 4)} \equiv \frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{Bx + C}{x^2 + 4}$. Multiply by $(x-1)(x^2 + 4)$:
\[
x = A(x^2 + 4) + (Bx + C)(x-1).
\]
For $x=1$, $1 = 5A \implies A = \frac{1}{5}$. Equate $x^2$: $A + B = 0 \implies B = -\frac{1}{5}$. Equate $x$: $C - B = 1 \implies C = \frac{4}{5}$. Thus:
\[
\frac{x}{(x-1)(x^2 + 4)} = \frac{1}{5(x-1)} - \frac{x - 4}{5(x^2 + 4)}.
\]

% Denominator with Repeated Linear and Quadratic Factors
\subsection*{Denominator with Repeated Linear and Quadratic Factors}

\textbf{Example 29.} Express $\frac{1}{x(x^2 + 1)^2}$ as partial fraction.

solution: Let $\frac{1}{x(x^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{A}{x} + \frac{Bx + C}{x^2 + 1} + \frac{Dx + E}{(x^2 + 1)^2}$. Multiply by $x(x^2 + 1)^2$:
\[
1 = A(x^2 + 1)^2 + (Bx + C)x(x^2 + 1) + (Dx + E)x.
\]
Equate coefficients: $A = 1$, $B = -1$, $C = 0$, $D = -1$, $E = 0$. Thus:
\[
\frac{1}{x(x^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{1}{x} - \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} - \frac{x}{(x^2 + 1)^2}.
\]
