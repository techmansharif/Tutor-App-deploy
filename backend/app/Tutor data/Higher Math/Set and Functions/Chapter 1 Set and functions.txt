% Part 1: Set Concepts
\part{Set Concepts}

% Defining a set
\subsection*{Set}
Any well-defined collection of objects of the real world or of the conceptual realm is called a Set. For example, $S=\{1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100\}$ denotes the set of square of natural numbers which are less than 10. The process of expressing set in this method is called Tabular Method. Each of the objects forming a set is called Element of that set. If $x$ is an element of a set $A$ then we write $x \in A$ and if $x$ is not an element of a set $A$ then we write $x \notin A$. The aforementioned set $S$ is written as $S=\{x: x \text{ is square number not greater than } 100\}$. This method is called Set Builder Method.

% Defining universal set
\subsection*{Universal Set}
Suppose,
\begin{align*}
    S &= \{x: x \text{ is a positive integer and } 5x \leq 16\} \\
    T &= \{x: x \text{ is a positive integer and } x^2 < 20\} \\
    P &= \{x: x \text{ is a positive integer and } \sqrt{x} \leq 2\}
\end{align*}
The elements of these three sets are formed by the set $U=\{x: x \text{ is a positive integer}\}$. $U$ can be considered as the universal set for sets $S, T, P$. If all the sets under discussion are included in a particular set, that particular set is called the universal set.

% Listing special number sets
\subsection*{Some Special Number Sets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N=\{1,2,3, \dots\}$, that is the set of all natural numbers or positive integers.
    \item $Z=\{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, \dots\}$, that is the set of all integers.
    \item $Q=\left\{x: x=\frac{p}{q}, \text{ where } p \text{ is any integer and } q \text{ is any positive integer}\right\}$, that is the set of all rational numbers.
    \item $R=\{x: x \text{ is a real number}\}$, so the set of all real numbers.
\end{itemize}

% Defining subset
\subsection*{Subset}
If $A$ and $B$ are sets then $A$ will be called the subset of $B$ if and only if every element of $A$ are elements of $B$ and it will be expressed as $A \subseteq B$. For example, $A=\{2,3\}$ is the subset of $B=\{2,3,5,7\}$. If $A$ is not the subset of $B$ then $A \nsubseteq B$ is written. For example, $A=\{1,3\}$ is not the subset of $B=\{2,3,5,7\}$.

% Example for subset relationships
\textbf{Example 1.} If $A=\{x: x \text{ is a positive integer}\}$, $B=\{0\}$ and $X=\{x: x \text{ is an integer}\}$, then what is the relationship between $A, B$ and $X$?

solution: Here, $A \subseteq X$, $B \subseteq X$, $B \nsubseteq A$.

% Defining empty set
\subsection*{Empty Set}
Sometimes such a set is considered which has no element. This kind of set is regarded as empty set and expressed as $\varnothing$ or \{\}.

% Examples for empty sets
\textbf{Example 2.} $\{x: x \text{ is a real number and } x^2<0\}$ is an empty set, because the square of any real number can never be negative.

\textbf{Example 3.} $F=\{x: x, \text{ African countries who won the FIFA world cup till 2014}\}$ is an empty set, because no African country has ever won the FIFA world cup till 2014.

% Defining equality of sets
\subsection*{Equality of Sets}
If $A$ and $B$ sets have the same elements then $A$ and $B$ are regarded to be equal and it is expressed as $A=B$. For example, $A=\{1,2,3,4\}$, $B=\{1,2,2,3,4,4,4\}$. It is to be noted that even though one element appears in a set repeatedly, it is considered same as appearing once. $A=B$ if and only if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$. This information is extremely important to prove the equality of sets.

% Defining proper subset
\subsection*{Proper Subset}
$A$ is the proper subset of $B$ if and only if $A \subseteq B$ and $A \neq B$. That means, every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$ and $B$ has at least one element which is not an element of $A$. For example, $A=\{1,2\}$, $B=\{1,2,3\}$. To express $A$ as a proper subset of $B$, $A \subset B$ is written.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For any set $A$, $A \subseteq A$. This is because $x \in A \implies x \in A$.
    \item For any set $A$, $\varnothing \subseteq A$. This is because if $\varnothing \subseteq A$ do not happen, $\varnothing$ will have one element $x$ that $A$ will not have. But this is never true because $\varnothing$ is an empty set. So, $\varnothing \subseteq A$. It should be mentioned that empty set or $\varnothing$ is a proper subset of any set.
\end{enumerate}

% Defining complementary set
\subsection*{Complementary Set}
If $U$ is an universal set and $A \subseteq U$, then the complementary set of $A$ is $U \backslash A$. So, $U \backslash A=\{x: x \in U \text{ and } x \notin A\}$. If the elements of $A$ is discarded from the universal set, then we get the complementary set of $A$ and it will be expressed as $A^{\prime}$ or $A^c$.

% Example for complementary set
\textbf{Example 5.} If universal set $U$ is the set of all integers and $A$ is the set of all negative integers, then (with respect to $U$), the complementary set of $A$ will be $A^{\prime}$ or $A^c=\{0,1,2,3, \dots\}$.

% Defining power set
\subsection*{Power Set}
The set of all subsets of $A$ is called the power set of $A$ and it is expressed as $P(A)$. It is to be noted that $\varnothing \subseteq A$. For this reason, $\varnothing$ is also an element of $P(A)$.

% Table for power sets
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
$A$ Set & $P(A)$ Power Set \\
\hline
$A=\varnothing$ & $P(A)=\{\varnothing\}$ \\
$A=\{a\}$ & $P(A)=\{\varnothing, A\}$ \\
$A=\{a, b\}$ & $P(A)=\{\varnothing,\{a\},\{b\}, A\}$ \\
$A=\{a, b, c\}$ & $P(A)=\{\varnothing,\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a, b\},\{a, c\},\{b, c\}, A\}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% Example for power set union
\textbf{Example 6.} If $A=\{a, b\}$ and $B=\{b, c\}$, show that $P(A) \cup P(B) \subseteq P(A \cup B)$.

solution: Here, $P(A)=\{\varnothing,\{a\},\{b\},\{a, b\}\}$, $P(B)=\{\varnothing,\{b\},\{c\},\{b, c\}\}$. \\
$\therefore P(A) \cup P(B)=\{\varnothing,\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a, b\},\{b, c\}\}$. \\
$A \cup B=\{a, b, c\}$, $P(A \cup B)=\{\varnothing,\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a, b\},\{a, c\},\{b, c\},\{a, b, c\}\}$. \\
So, $P(A) \cup P(B) \subseteq P(A \cup B)$.

% Part 2: Set Operations
\part{Set Operations}

% Defining difference of sets
\subsection*{Difference of Sets}
If $A$ and $B$ are sets, $A \backslash B$ is $\{x: x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B\}$. $A \backslash B$ is called $A$ delete $B$ and the elements of $A$ that are present in $B$ are discarded from $A$ to form $A \backslash B$. $A \backslash B \subseteq A$.

% Example for difference of sets
\textbf{Example 4.} If $A=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ and $B=\{0,2,4,6,8,10\}$ then $A \backslash B=\{1,3,5,7,9\}$.

% Introducing Venn diagrams
\subsection*{Venn Diagram}
Sometimes expressing set related information in diagrams is quite convenient. These diagrams are named Venn diagram after the name of John Venn (1834-1923). This has been discussed briefly in the Mathematics book.

% Example for complementary set Venn diagram
\textbf{Example 7.} The Venn diagram of $A^{\prime}$, which is the complementary set of $A$ with respect to the universal set $U$:

Image description: A Venn diagram showing a universal set $U$ as a large rectangle, with a smaller circle inside representing set $A$. The area outside the circle but within the rectangle is shaded to denote $A^{\prime}$, the complement of $A$.

% Defining union of sets
\subsection*{Union of Sets}
If $A$ and $B$ are sets then their union of sets is $A \cup B=\{x: x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}$. So, the set formed by the elements of both $A$ and $B$ is called $A \cup B$.

% Defining intersection of sets
\subsection*{Intersection of Sets}
If $A$ and $B$ are sets, their intersection of sets is $A \cap B=\{x: x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}$. That means, the set formed by all common elements of $A$ and $B$ is called $A \cap B$.

% Example for set operations
\textbf{Example 8.} Two subsets of universal set $U=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ are $A=\{x: x \text{ prime number}\}$ and $B=\{x: x \text{ odd number}\}$. \\
So $A=\{2,3,5,7\}$ and $B=\{1,3,5,7,9\}$. \\
Therefore, $A \cup B=\{1,2,3,5,7,9\}$, $A \cap B=\{3,5,7\}$, \\
$A^{\prime}=\{0,1,4,6,8,9\}$, $B^{\prime}=\{0,2,4,6,8\}$, \\
$A^{\prime} \cup B^{\prime}=\{0,1,2,4,6,8,9\}$, $A^{\prime} \cap B^{\prime}=\{0,4,6,8\}$, \\
$(A \cap B)^{\prime}=\{0,1,2,4,6,8,9\}$, $(A \cup B)^{\prime}=\{0,4,6,8\}$.

% Defining disjoint sets
\subsection*{Disjoint Set}
If $A$ and $B$ are such sets that $A \cap B=\varnothing$, then $A$ and $B$ are called disjoint sets.

% Examples for disjoint sets
\textbf{Example 9.} If $A=\{x: x \text{ positive integer}\}$ and $B=\{x: x \text{ negative real number}\}$ then $A$ and $B$ are disjoint sets, $A \cap B=\varnothing$.

\textbf{Example 10.} If $A=\{x: x \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } 0 \leq x \leq 2\}$ and $B=\{x: x \in \mathbb{N} \text{ and } 0 \leq x \leq 2\}$ then $B \subseteq A$, $A \cup B=A$, $A \cap B=B=\{1,2\}$.

\textbf{Example 11.} If $A=\{x: x \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } 1 \leq x \leq 2\}$ and $B=\{x: x \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } 0 < x < 1\}$, $A \cup B=\{x: x \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } 0 < x \leq 2\}$ and $A \cap B=\varnothing$, So, $A$ and $B$ are disjoint sets.

% Defining Cartesian product set
\subsection*{Cartesian Product Set}
The Cartesian Product Set of two sets $A$ and $B$ is $A \times B=\{(x, y): x \in A \text{ and } y \in B\}$.

% Example for Cartesian product
\textbf{Example 12.} $A=\{1,2\}$, $B=\{a, b, c\}$ are two sets. So the Cartesian Product of these two sets is $A \times B=\{(1, a),(1, b),(1, c),(2, a),(2, b),(2, c)\}$.

        \item $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{De Morgan's Law}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(A \cup B)^{\prime} = A^{\prime} \cap B^{\prime}$
        \item $(A \cap B)^{\prime} = A^{\prime} \cup B^{\prime}$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Other Formulas}

        \item $A \cup A = A$, $A \cap A = A$
        \item $A \cup \varnothing = A$, $A \cap \varnothing = \varnothing$
        \item $A \cup U = U$, $A \cap U = A$
        \item $A \subseteq B \implies B^{\prime} \subseteq A^{\prime}$
        \item $A \subseteq B \implies A \cup B = B$
        \item $A \subseteq B \implies A \cap B = A$
        \item $A \subseteq A \cup B$
        \item $A \cap B \subseteq A$
        \item $A \backslash B = A \cap B^{\prime}$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

% Verifying commutative law
\textbf{Verification of the Two Propositions of the Commutative Law} \\
The shaded area of the following left diagram denotes both $A \cup B$ and $B \cup A$. So in this case, we see that $A \cup B = B \cup A$. On the other hand, the shaded area of the right-sided diagram shows both $A \cap B$ and $B \cap A$. So in this case, it is seen that $A \cap B = B \cap A$.

Image description: Two Venn diagrams side by side. The left diagram shows two overlapping circles representing sets $A$ and $B$, with the entire area of both circles shaded to indicate $A \cup B$ and $B \cup A$. The right diagram shows the same circles with only the overlapping section shaded to indicate $A \cap B$ and $B \cap A$.

% Example for commutative law
Here the verification shown above is done with the help of Venn Diagram. Now let's see this with a definite example. \\
Suppose, $A=\{1,2,4\}$ and $B=\{2,3,5\}$ are two sets. \\
So, $A \cup B=\{1,2,4\} \cup \{2,3,5\}=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. \\
Again, $B \cup A=\{2,3,5\} \cup \{1,2,4\}=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. \\
So in this case, $A \cup B = B \cup A$. \\
On the other hand, $A \cap B=\{1,2,4\} \cap \{2,3,5\}=\{2\}$ \\
and $B \cap A=\{2,3,5\} \cap \{1,2,4\}=\{2\}$. \\
So here, $A \cap B = B \cap A$.

% Verifying associative law
\textbf{Verification of the Two Propositions of the Associative Law} \\
The shaded area of the following left diagram denotes both $A \cup (B \cup C)$ and $(A \cup B) \cup C$. So in this case $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C$. The shaded area of the right-sided diagram shows $A \cap (B \cap C)$ and $(A \cap B) \cap C$. So here we can say that $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$.

Image description: Two Venn diagrams side by side. The left diagram shows three overlapping circles representing sets $A$, $B$, and $C$, with the entire area of all circles shaded to indicate $A \cup (B \cup C)$ and $(A \cup B) \cup C$. The right diagram shows the same circles with only the region where all three circles overlap shaded to indicate $A \cap (B \cap C)$ and $(A \cap B) \cap C$.

% Example for associative law
Here the verification shown above is done with the help of Venn Diagram. Now let's see this with a definite example. \\
Suppose, $A=\{a, b, c, d\}$, $B=\{b, c, f\}$ and $C=\{c, d, g\}$. \\
So, $B \cup C=\{b, c, f\} \cup \{c, d, g\}=\{b, c, d, f, g\}$ \\
and $A \cup (B \cup C)=\{a, b, c, d\} \cup \{b, c, d, f, g\}=\{a, b, c, d, f, g\}$. \\
Again, $A \cup B=\{a, b, c, d\} \cup \{b, c, f\}=\{a, b, c, d, f\}$ \\
and $(A \cup B) \cup C=\{a, b, c, d, f\} \cup \{c, d, g\}=\{a, b, c, d, f, g\}$. \\
So in this case, $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$. \\
Again, $B \cap C=\{b, c, f\} \cap \{c, d, g\}=\{c\}$ \\
and $A \cap (B \cap C)=\{a, b, c, d\} \cap \{c\}=\{c\}$. \\
Again, $A \cap B=\{a, b, c, d\} \cap \{b, c, f\}=\{b, c\}$ \\
and $(A \cap B) \cap C=\{b, c\} \cap \{c, d, g\}=\{c\}$. \\
So here, $A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C$.

% Observation on distributive laws
\textbf{Observation:} Each of the operations of union and intersection of sets is distributive with respect to one another.

% Proving De Morgan's Law
\textbf{Proposition 1 (De Morgan's Law).} For any subset $A$ and $B$ of a universal set $U$,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(A \cup B)^{\prime} = A^{\prime} \cap B^{\prime}$
    \item $(A \cap B)^{\prime} = A^{\prime} \cup B^{\prime}$
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Proof:} (The proof of only the first part is shown below. Prove the second one yourself.) \\
Suppose, $x \in (A \cup B)^{\prime}$. So, $x \notin A \cup B$. \\
\[
\Rightarrow x \notin A \text{ and } x \notin B \Rightarrow x \in A^{\prime} \text{ and } x \in B^{\prime} \Rightarrow x \in A^{\prime} \cap B^{\prime}
\]
\[
\therefore (A \cup B)^{\prime} \subseteq A^{\prime} \cap B^{\prime}.
\]
Again, suppose, $x \in A^{\prime} \cap B^{\prime}$. So, $x \in A^{\prime}$ and $x \in B^{\prime}$. \\
\[
\Rightarrow x \notin A \text{ and } x \notin B \Rightarrow x \notin A \cup B \Rightarrow x \in (A \cup B)^{\prime}
\]
\[
\therefore A^{\prime} \cap B^{\prime} \subseteq (A \cup B)^{\prime}.
\]
Therefore, $(A \cup B)^{\prime} = A^{\prime} \cap B^{\prime}$.

% Proving difference as intersection with complement
\textbf{Proposition 2.} For any subset $A$ and $B$ of a universal set $U$, $A \backslash B = A \cap B^{\prime}$

\textbf{Proof:} Suppose, $x \in A \backslash B$. So, $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$, \\
\[
\Rightarrow x \in A \text{ and } x \in B^{\prime} \Rightarrow x \in A \cap B^{\prime}
\]
\[
\therefore A \backslash B \subseteq A \cap B^{\prime}.
\]
Again suppose, $x \in A \cap B^{\prime}$. So, $x \in A$ and $x \in B^{\prime}$. \\
\[
\Rightarrow x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B \Rightarrow x \in A \backslash B
\]
\[
\therefore A \cap B^{\prime} \subseteq A \backslash B.
\]
So, $A \backslash B = A \cap B^{\prime}$.

% Proving Cartesian product properties
\textbf{Proposition 3.} For any set $A, B, C$ we have,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A \times (B \cap C) = (A \times B) \cap (A \times C)$
    \item $A \times (B \cup C) = (A \times B) \cup (A \times C)$
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Proof:} (The proof of only the first part is shown below. Prove the next one yourself.) \\
According to the definition, $A \times (B \cap C)$ \\
\[
= \{(x, y): x \in A, y \in B \cap C\}
\]
\[
= \{(x, y): x \in A, y \in B \text{ and } y \in C\}
\]
\[
= \{(x, y): (x, y) \in A \times B \text{ and } (x, y) \in A \times C\}
\]
\[
= \{(x, y): (x, y) \in (A \times B) \cap (A \times C)\}
\]
\[
\therefore A \times (B \cap C) \subseteq (A \times B) \cap (A \times C)
\]
Again, $(A \times B) \cap (A \times C)$ \\
\[
= \{(x, y): (x, y) \in A \times B \text{ and } (x, y) \in A \times C\}
\]
\[
= \{(x, y): x \in A, y \in B \text{ and } x \in A, y \in C\}
\]
\[
= \{(x, y): x \in A, y \in B \cap C\}
\]
\[
= \{(x, y): (x, y) \in A \times (B \cap C)\}
\]
\[
\therefore (A \times B) \cap (A \times C) \subseteq A \times (B \cap C)
\]
So, $A \times (B \cap C) = (A \times B) \cap (A \times C)$.

% Listing additional set propositions
\subsection*{Some More Propositions of the Method of Sets}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $A$ is any set $A \subseteq A$
    \item The empty set $\varnothing$ is the subset of any set $A$.
    \item If $A$ and $B$ are any sets, $A = B$ provided if and only if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$.
    \item If $A \subseteq \varnothing$, then $A = \varnothing$.
    \item If $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$ then, $A \subseteq C$.
    \item For any set $A$ and $B$, $A \cap B \subseteq A$ and $A \cap B \subseteq B$.
    \item For any set $A$ and $B$, $A \subseteq A \cup B$ and $B \subseteq A \cup B$.
\end{enumerate}

% Proving selected propositions
\textbf{Proof:} Only proofs of two propositions are given. Do the others.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[4)] Given, $A \subseteq \varnothing$, also we know, $\varnothing \subseteq A$. Therefore $A = \varnothing$.
    \item[7)] According to the definition of union of sets, $A \cup B$ consists of the common elements and all elements of $A$. So as per the definition of subset, $A \subseteq A \cup B$. By the same logic $B \subseteq A \cup B$.
\end{enumerate}

% Part 4: Finite/Infinite Sets and Equivalence
\part{Finite/Infinite Sets and Equivalence}

% Defining one-one correspondence
\subsection*{One-One Correspondence}
Suppose, $A=\{a, b, c\}$ is a set of three persons and $B=\{30,40,50\}$ is the set of their ages. Moreover, suppose, the age of $a$ is 30 years, the age of $b$ is 40 years and the age of $c$ is 50 years. So it can be said that, there is an one-one correspondence between the sets $A$ and $B$.

% Definition of one-one correspondence
\textbf{Definition 1 (One-One Correspondence).} If the matching of an element of $B$ with every element of $A$ and an element of $A$ with every element of $B$ are established, such matching is called an one-one correspondence. The one-one correspondence between sets $A$ and $B$ is usually expressed as $A \leftrightarrow B$ and if any element $x$ of the set $A$ corresponds to the element $y$ of the set $B$, we write $x \leftrightarrow y$.

% Defining equivalent sets
\subsection*{Equivalent Set}
Let, $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{a, b, c\}$ are two sets. An one-one correspondence between the sets $A$ and $B$ is shown in the figure below:

Image description: A diagram showing a one-one correspondence between sets $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $B=\{a, b, c\}$, with arrows connecting each element of $A$ to a unique element of $B$, such as $1 \leftrightarrow a$, $2 \leftrightarrow b$, and $3 \leftrightarrow c$.

% Definition of equivalent sets
\textbf{Definition 2 (Equivalent Set).} Any sets $A$ and $B$ are regarded as equivalent sets if one can establish an one-one correspondence $A \leftrightarrow B$ between them. $A \sim B$ is written to indicate that $A$ and $B$ are equivalent. If $A \sim B$, one of them is called equivalent to the other. Notice that, for sets $A, B$ and $C$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A \sim A$
    \item If $A \sim B$, then $B \sim A$
    \item If $A \sim B$ and $B \sim C$, then $A \sim C$.
\end{enumerate}

% Example for equivalent sets
\textbf{Example 13.} Show that, $A=\{1,2,3, \dots, n\}$ and $B=\{1,3,5, \dots, 2n-1\}$ are equivalent sets, where $n$ is a natural number.

solution: $A$ and $B$ are equivalent, because the two sets have an one-one correspondence as shown below:

Image description: A diagram illustrating a one-one correspondence between sets $A=\{1,2,3,\dots,n\}$ and $B=\{1,3,5,\dots,2n-1\}$, with arrows connecting each element $k \in A$ to $2k-1 \in B$.

\textbf{Remarks:} The one-one correspondence indicated above can be described by $A \leftrightarrow B: k \leftrightarrow 2k-1, k \in A$.

% Example for infinite sets
\textbf{Example 14.} Show that, the set of natural numbers $N$ and the set of even natural numbers $A=\{2,4,6, \dots, 2n, \dots\}$, are equivalent.

solution: $N=\{1,2,3, \dots, n, \dots\}$ and $A$ are equivalent sets, because an one-one correspondence between the sets $N$ and $A$ can be established, which is shown below.

Image description: A diagram showing a one-one correspondence between the set of natural numbers $N=\{1,2,3,\dots\}$ and the set of even natural numbers $A=\{2,4,6,\dots\}$, with arrows connecting each $n \in N$ to $2n \in A$.

\textbf{Remarks:} The one-one correspondence indicated above, can be described by $N \leftrightarrow A: n \leftrightarrow 2n, n \in N$.

% Observation on empty set
\textbf{Observation:} Empty set $\varnothing$ is supposed to be equivalent to itself. So, $\varnothing \sim \varnothing$.

% Proving set equivalence
\textbf{Proposition 4.} Every set $A$ is equivalent to itself. That means, $A \sim A$.

\textbf{Proof:} If $A = \varnothing$, it is taken $A \sim A$. On the other hand, if $A \neq \varnothing$, every element makes a one-one correspondence with $x$ by itself to establish a one-one correspondence $A \leftrightarrow A: x \leftrightarrow x, x \in A$. So $A \sim A$.

% Proving transitivity of equivalence
\textbf{Proposition 5.} If $A$ and $B$ are equivalent sets and $B$ and $C$ equivalent sets, then $A$ and $C$ are equivalent too.

\textbf{Proof:} As $A \sim B$, we can associate every element $x$ of $A$ with a unique element $y$ of $B$. Again, since $B \sim C$, we can associate with that element $y$ of $B$ a unique element $z$ of $C$. So we can associate the element $x$ of $A$ with the unique elements $z$ of $C$. This association of the elements of $A$ with the elements of $C$ is a one-one correspondence between them. So, $A \sim C$.

% Defining intervals
\subsection*{Interval}
If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $a < b$,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a < x < b\}$ is called open interval.
    \item $[a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \leq x \leq b\}$ is called closed interval.
    \item $(a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a < x \leq b\}$ and $[a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: a \leq x < b\}$ are respectively called open-closed interval and closed-open interval.
\end{enumerate}

% Defining finite and infinite sets
\subsection*{Finite and Infinite Sets}
Counting the elements of the set $A=\{15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22\}$, we see that $A$ has 8 elements. This counting is completed by establishing a one-one correspondence of the set $A$ with the set $B=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$, as shown below:

Image description: A diagram showing a one-one correspondence between set $A=\{15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22\}$ and set $B=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$, with arrows connecting each element of $A$ to a unique element of $B$, such as $15 \leftrightarrow 1$, $16 \leftrightarrow 2$, and so on.

% Definition of finite and infinite sets
\textbf{Definition 3 (Finite and Infinite Sets).} A set whose elements can be fixed by counting, is called a finite set. If any set $A$ is not a finite set, then it is called infinite set.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Empty set $\varnothing$ is a finite set, whose number of elements is 0.
    \item If any set $A$ and $J_m=\{1,2,3, \dots, m\}$ are equivalent, where $m \in \mathbb{N}$, then $A$ is a finite set and the number of elements of $A$ is $m$.
    \item If $A$ is a finite set, the number of elements of $A$ is denoted by $n(A)$.
\end{enumerate}

% Notes on finite sets
\textbf{Note:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $J_1=\{1\}$, $J_2=\{1,2\}$, $J_3=\{1,2,3\}$ is the finite subset of $N$ and $n(J_1)=1$, $n(J_2)=2$, $n(J_3)=3$ etc. In real sense, $J_m \sim J_m$ and $n(J_m)=m$.
    \item Only the number of elements in a finite set can be fixed. So notation $n(A)$ implies that $A$ is a finite set.
    \item If $A$ and $B$ are equivalent sets and if one of them is finite, then the other set must be finite and $n(A)=n(B)$ will hold.
\end{enumerate}

% Proposition for finite sets
\textbf{Proposition 6.} If $A$ is a finite set and $B$ is a proper subset of $A$, then $B$ will be a finite set and there will be $n(B) < n(A)$.

% Proposition for infinite sets
\textbf{Proposition 7.} Set $A$ is infinite if and only if there exists $A$ and a proper subset equivalent to $A$.

% Observation on natural numbers
\textbf{Observation:} Set of natural numbers $N$ is an infinite set.

% Explaining number of elements
\subsection*{Number of Elements of Finite Sets}
Elements of finite set $A$ is denoted by $n(A)$ and how to determine $n(A)$ is explained. Now, suppose $n(A)=p>0$, $n(B)=q>0$ where $A \cap B = \varnothing$.

Image description: A diagram showing two non-overlapping sets $A$ and $B$, with a one-one correspondence established between $A \cup B$ and a set $J_{p+q}$, indicating that the number of elements in $A \cup B$ is $p+q$.

From the above mentioned one-one correspondence, we see that $A \cup B \sim J_{p+q}$. \\
So, $n(A \cup B) = p + q = n(A) + n(B)$. From this we can say the following proposition.

% Proposition for disjoint sets
\textbf{Proposition 8.} If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint finite set to each other, then $n(A \cup B) = n(A) + n(B)$.

% Expanding proposition
Expanding the proposition, we can say, $n(A \cup B \cup C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C)$. \\
Similarly, $n(A \cup B \cup C \cup D) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) + n(D)$ etc, \\
where $A, B, C, D$ sets are disjoint finite set to one another.

% Proposition for union of sets
\textbf{Proposition 9.} For any finite set $A$ and $B$, $n(A \cup B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \cap B)$.

% Proof for union proposition
\textbf{Proof:} Here, $A \backslash B$, $A \cap B$ and $B \backslash A$ are disjoint sets to each other [See Venn Diagram].

Image description: A Venn diagram showing two overlapping circles representing sets $A$ and $B$. The diagram is divided into three disjoint regions: $A \backslash B$, $A \cap B$, and $B \backslash A$, illustrating the components of $A \cup B$.

So, $A = (A \backslash B) \cup (A \cap B)$ and $B = (B \backslash A) \cup (A \cap B)$ \\
Therefore, $A \cup B = (A \backslash B) \cup (A \cap B) \cup (B \backslash A)$ \\
\[
\therefore n(A) = n(A \backslash B) + n(A \cap B) \quad \cdots (1)
\]
\[
\therefore n(B) = n(B \backslash A) + n(A \cap B) \quad \cdots (2)
\]
\[
n(A \cup B) = n(A \backslash B) + n(A \cap B) + n(B \backslash A) \quad \cdots (3)
\]
So, from (1) we get, $n(A \backslash B) = n(A) - n(A \cap B)$ \\
and from (2) we get, $n(B \backslash A) = n(B) - n(A \cap B)$ \\
Now, putting $n(A \backslash B)$ and $n(B \backslash A)$ in (3), we get \\
\[
n(A \cup B) = n(A) - n(A \cap B) + n(B) - n(A \cap B) + n(A \cap B)
\]
\[
\therefore n(A \cup B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \cap B)
\]

% Part 5: Real-Life Problems
\part{Real-Life Problems}

% Introducing real-life applications
\subsection*{Set in Solving Real-Life Problems}
Venn diagrams are used to solve real-life problems. Here it is noted that the elements of each set which will be written down in Venn diagram, is shown through some examples.

% Example for language problem
\textbf{Example 15.} Out of 50 persons, 35 can speak English, 25 can speak both English and Bangla and every one can speak at least one of these two languages. How many persons can speak Bangla? How many persons can speak only Bangla?

solution: Let, $S$ be the set of the 50 persons, $E$ be the set of persons among them who can speak in English, $B$ be the set of persons who can speak in Bangla. \\
So according to the question, $n(S)=50$, $n(E)=35$, $n(E \cap B)=25$ and $S = E \cup B$. Suppose, $n(B)=x$. \\
Then from, $n(S) = n(E \cup B) = n(E) + n(B) - n(E \cap B)$, we get \\
\[
50 = 35 + x - 25 \quad \text{or,} \quad x = 50 - 35 + 25 = 40 \quad \text{So,} \quad n(B) = 40
\]
$\therefore 40$ persons can speak in Bangla. \\
Now, the set of those who can speak in only Bangla is $(B \backslash E)$. \\
Let, $n(B \backslash E) = y$. \\
As the sets $E \cap B$ and $(B \backslash E)$ are disjoint and $B = (E \cap B) \cup (B \backslash E)$ [See Venn Diagram]

Image description: A Venn diagram with two overlapping circles representing sets $E$ (English speakers) and $B$ (Bangla speakers) within a universal set $S$. The diagram shows $E \cap B$ with 25 elements, $E \backslash B$ with 10 elements, and $B \backslash E$ with 15 elements, indicating the distribution of language speakers.

Therefore, $n(B) = n(E \cap B) + n(B \backslash E)$. \\
\[
\therefore 40 = 25 + y \quad \text{or,} \quad y = 40 - 25 = 15 \quad \text{So,} \quad n(B \backslash E) = 15
\]
$\therefore 15$ persons can speak in only Bangla. \\
So, 40 persons can speak in Bangla and 15 persons can speak in only Bangla.

% Example for activity preferences
\textbf{Example 16.} Each of the 35 girls in a class likes at least one activity among running, swimming and dancing. Among them 15 girls like running, 4 like all three of swimming, running and dancing, 2 like just running, 7 like both running and swimming but not dancing, $x$ like both swimming and dancing but not running, $2x$ like only dancing, while 2 girls like only swimming.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show these information in a Venn Diagram.
    \item Find $x$.
    \item Express the set of the girls who like both running and dancing, but not swimming.
    \item What is the number of girls who like both running and dancing but not swimming?
\end{enumerate}

solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose, set $J=$ those who like running, $S=$ those who like swimming, $D=$ those who like dancing. Now let's look at the Venn Diagram shown above.
    
    Image description: A Venn diagram with three overlapping circles representing sets $J$ (running), $S$ (swimming), and $D$ (dancing). The diagram includes regions labeled with the number of girls in each: 2 in $J \backslash (S \cup D)$, 7 in $J \cap S \cap D^{\prime}$, $y$ in $J \cap D \cap S^{\prime}$, 4 in $J \cap S \cap D$, 2 in $S \backslash (J \cup D)$, $x$ in $S \cap D \cap J^{\prime}$, and $2x$ in $D \backslash (J \cup S)$.
    
    \item From the Venn Diagram $J^{\prime}=\{\text{the girls who do not like running}\}$. \\
    So, $n(J^{\prime}) = 35 - 15 = 20 \quad \text{or,} \quad 2x + x + 2 = 20 \quad \text{or,} \quad 3x = 18 \quad \text{or,} \quad x = 6$.
    \item Set of the girls who like both running and dancing but not swimming: $J \cap D \cap S^{\prime}$.
    \item $n(J \cap D \cap S^{\prime}) = y$ is shown in the Venn Diagram and given that $n(J) = 15$. \\
    \[
    \therefore y + 4 + 7 + 2 = 15 \quad \text{or,} \quad y = 2.
    \]
    Therefore, only 2 girls like running and dancing but not swimming.
\end{enumerate}

% Example for sports preferences
\textbf{Example 17.} Out of 24 students, 18 like to play basketball, 12 like to play volleyball. Given that $U=$ the set of the students, $B=$ the set of students who like to play basketball, $V=$ the set of students who like to play volleyball. Suppose, $n(B \cap V) = x$ and explain the data below in Venn diagram:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe the set $B \cup V$ and express $n(B \cup V)$ in terms of $x$.
    \item Find the possible minimum value of $x$.
    \item Find the possible maximum value of $x$.
\end{enumerate}

solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $B \cup V$ is the set of the students who like to play basketball or volleyball. \\
    \[
    n(B \cup V) = (18 - x) + x + (12 - x) = 30 - x
    \]
    \item $x$ or $n(B \cap V)$ is the smallest, when $B \cup V = U$ \\
    So, $n(B \cup V) = n(U)$ or $30 - x = 24$ or $x = 6$ \\
    $\therefore$ The possible minimum value of $x = 6$.
    \item $n(B \cap V)$ is the largest when $V \subset B$ \\
    Then, $n(B \cap V) = n(V)$ or $x = 12$ \\
    $\therefore$ Possible maximum value of $x = 12$.
\end{enumerate}

Image description: A Venn diagram with two overlapping circles representing sets $B$ (students who like basketball) and $V$ (students who like volleyball) within a universal set $U$ of 24 students. The diagram shows $B \cap V$ with $x$ elements, $B \backslash V$ with $18 - x$ elements, $V \backslash B$ with $12 - x$ elements, and the region outside $B \cup V$ within $U$ representing students who like neither sport.

% Part 6: Relations and Functions
\part{Relations and Functions}

% Function Section
\subsection*{Function}
The idea of function is as important as sets in mathematics. In practical need, relations between two variables or two sets are considered.

% Relation Section
\subsection*{Relation}
We often consider different types of relations among the elements of set $X$ or among the elements of set $X$ and set $Y$. For example, greater-lesser relation in the set of natural numbers, brother-sister relation in a family, relation of age with your classmates in your recent birthday. For further information regarding this context, please refer to the Mathematics book of class 9-10.

\textbf{Example 18.} Suppose $A=\{0,1,2,3\}$ is a set. The $x<y$ relation existing between the elements of the set $A$ can be described by subset of $A \times A$ which is $S=\{(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)\}$, where for ordered pairs included under $S$ (first entry) $<$ (second entry). Here $S$ is the $<$ relation described under $A$.

solution: The set $S$ correctly represents the relation $x < y$ on $A$.

\textbf{Example 19.} Suppose, $a$ is the father, $b$ is the mother, $c$ is the elder son, $d$ is the younger son, $e$ is the daughter, $f$ is the wife of the elder son in a family. Assuming the set of members of the family as $F$, we get $F=\{a, b, c, d, e, f\}$. The brother relation in set $F$, which means the brother relation between $x$ and $y$ can be described by $B=\{(c, d),(c, e),(d, c),(d, e)\}$, where the first entry of the ordered pairs under set $B$ is the brother of the second entry of the same ordered pair. The set $B$ denotes the brother relation of set $F$.

solution: The set $B$ should include pairs where $c$ and $d$ are brothers to each other, but $e$ (daughter) is not a brother. Correct $B=\{(c, d),(d, c)\}$.

\subsection*{Definition 4 (Relation)}
If two sets are $X$ and $Y$, any subset of their Cartesian product set $X \times Y$ is called relation from $X$ to $Y$. So, $R \subseteq X \times Y$ is a relation from $X$ to $Y$.

\textbf{Example 20.} Relation between the radius and circumference of a circle is expressed as $p=2 \pi r$ where variables $r$ and $p$ denote the radius andლ

solution: The function $f(r)=2 \pi r$ maps each radius to a unique circumference.

\subsection*{Definition 5 (Function)}
If $X$ and $Y$ are sets and under any rule, every element of set $X$ is associated with one and only one element of set $Y$, that rule is called a function described from $X$ to $Y$. These types of functions are indicated with symbols such as $f, g, F, G$ etc.

\subsection*{Definition 6 (Domain and Codomain)}
If $f$ is a function from set $X$ to set $Y$, then this is expressed as $f: X \rightarrow Y$. $X$ set is called domain of function $f: X \rightarrow Y$, while set $Y$ is called codomain.

\subsection*{Definition 7 (Image and Preimage)}
If under function $f: X \rightarrow Y$, $x \in X$ is associated with $y \in Y$, then $y$ is called image of $x$ and $x$ is called preimage of $y$ under this function and it is expressed as $y=f(x)$.

\subsection*{Definition 8 (Range)}
Under function $f: X \rightarrow Y$, the set of the elements of $Y$ which are the images of any element of $X$ is regarded as range of function $f$ and it is expressed as "range $f$". So, range $f=\{y: y=f(x) \text{ where } x \in X\}=\{f(x): x \in X\}$. To be noted that range $f$ is the subset of codomain $Y$.

Function can be described in different ways. Let's take a look at the following examples.

\textbf{Example 21.} $f: x \rightarrow 2x+1$, $x \in \mathbb{Z}$; describes a function from the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$. Under this function image of $x$ is $y=f(x)=2x+1$; the domain of the function, domain $f=\mathbb{Z}$ and range of the function, range $f=\{y: y=2x+1, x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is the set of all odd integers.

solution: The function maps integers to odd integers, with domain $\mathbb{Z}$ and range $\{1,3,5,\dots\} \cup \{-1,-3,-5,\dots\}$.

\textbf{Example 22.} A set of ordered pairs $F=\{(0,0),(1,1),(-1,1),(2,4),(-2,4),(3,9),(-3,9)\}$ describes a function, whose domain is a set of first entries of the ordered pairs under $F$ and range is set of second entries of the ordered pairs under $F$.

solution: Domain $F=\{0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3\}$, range $F=\{0,1,4,9\}$. The function is $F(x)=x^2$.

\subsection*{Inverse Function}
Three functions are described below in the following three diagrams.

Image description: Three diagrams showing functions via arrows between sets. Left: From $\{a, b, c\}$ to $\{1,2,3,4\}$, with $a \rightarrow 1$, $b \rightarrow 2$, $c \rightarrow 4$ (one-one, not onto). Middle: From $\{a, b, c\}$ to $\{1,2\}$, with $a \rightarrow 1$, $b \rightarrow 2$, $c \rightarrow 2$ (onto, not one-one). Right: From $\{a, b, c\}$ to $\{1,2,3\}$, with $a \rightarrow 2$, $b \rightarrow 1$, $c \rightarrow 3$ (one-one and onto).

\textbf{Problem.} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Under the left sided diagram drawn above, $a \rightarrow 1$, $b \rightarrow 2$, $c \rightarrow 4$. This function is one-one but not onto since there exists no preimage of 3.
    \item Under the diagram drawn in the middle above, $a \rightarrow 1$, $b \rightarrow 2$, $c \rightarrow 2$. This function is onto but not one-one since 2 is the image of $b$ and $c$.
    \item Under the right sided diagram drawn above $a \rightarrow 2$, $b \rightarrow 1$, $c \rightarrow 3$. This function is one-one and onto. In the last case, for every element of codomain $D$, domain $A$ has one and only one element which is definite. As a result, a function is described from $D$ to $A$, which is called the inverse function of given function.
\end{enumerate}

solution: The descriptions are correct. Only the right diagram allows an inverse function.

\subsection*{Definition 9 (Inverse Function)}
Suppose, $f: A \rightarrow B$ is a one-one and onto function. If a function $g: B \rightarrow A$ is described where for every $b \in B$, $g(b)=a$ if and only if $f(a)=b$, that function $g$ is defined as the inverse function of $f$. This is indicated as $f^{-1}$ so, $g=f^{-1}$.

If the function is $f$ in the right-sided diagram drawn above, $f^{-1}: D \rightarrow A$ and $f^{-1}(1)=b$, $f^{-1}(2)=a$, $f^{-1}(3)=c$. However, in case of the other two diagrams, an inverse function is not possible.

\textbf{Example 24.} Suppose, $A=\{2,3,5,7\}$ and $B=\{1,2,4,7,10\}$. Those elements of $B$ which are divisible by the elements of $A$ are shown below by drawing a diagram using arrow signs:

Image description: A diagram with arrows from $A=\{2,3,5,7\}$ to $B=\{1,2,4,7,10\}$, showing divisibility: $2 \rightarrow 2$, $2 \rightarrow 4$, $2 \rightarrow 10$, $5 \rightarrow 10$, $7 \rightarrow 7$.

solution: The relation $D=\{(2,2),(2,4),(2,10),(5,10),(7,7)\} \subset A \times B$ is not a function since 2 maps to multiple elements.

\textbf{Example 25.} Let's consider the set of ordered pairs of real numbers $L=\{(x, y): x \in \mathbb{R}, y \in \mathbb{R} \text{ and } x < y\}$. $a < b$ for two real numbers $a, b$ if and only if $(a, b) \in L$. Therefore, the set $L$ describes the relation of lesser or greater.

solution: $L$ is a relation, not a function, as each $x$ maps to multiple $y$.

\textbf{Example 26.} Which one of the following relations is not a function? Give reasons.

Image description: Four diagrams showing relations via arrows. Upper left: From $\{1,2,3\}$ to $\{4,5\}$, with $1 \rightarrow 4$, $2 \rightarrow 4$, $2 \rightarrow 5$, $3 \rightarrow 4$, $3 \rightarrow 5$. Upper right: From $\{1,2,3\}$ to $\{4,5\}$, with $1 \rightarrow 4$, $2 \rightarrow 5$, $3 \rightarrow 4$. Lower left: From $\{1,2,3\}$ to $\{4,5\}$, with $1 \rightarrow 4$, $2 \rightarrow 4$, $3 \rightarrow 5$. Lower right: From $\{1,2,3\}$ to $\{4,5\}$, with $1 \rightarrow 5$, $2 \rightarrow 4$, $3 \rightarrow 4$.

solution: The upper left relation is not a function because $2 \rightarrow 4$, $2 \rightarrow 5$ and $3 \rightarrow 4$, $3 \rightarrow 5$. The others are functions.

\textbf{Example 27.} Find the range of the function $f: x \rightarrow 2x^2+1$ where the domain is $X=\{1,2,3\}$.

solution: $f(1)=2(1)^2+1=3$, $f(2)=2(2)^2+1=9$, $f(3)=2(3)^2+1=19$. Range $=\{3,9,19\}$.

\textbf{Example 28.} For the function $f: x \rightarrow mx+c$, the images of 2 and 4 are respectively 7 and $-1$. So find out:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The values of $m$ and $c$.
    \item The image of 5 under $f$.
    \item The preimage of 3 under $f$.
\end{enumerate}

solution: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f(2)=2m+c=7$, $f(4)=4m+c=-1$. Solving: $2m+c=7$, $4m+c=-1 \implies 2m=-8 \implies m=-4$, $c=15$.
    \item $f(5)=-4 \cdot 5+15=-5$.
    \item $f(x)=3 \implies -4x+15=3 \implies x=3$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example 29.} Find the domain of the function $F(x)=\sqrt{1-x}$. Find whichever is defined among $F(-3)$, $F(0)$, $F\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$, $F(1)$, $F(2)$.

solution: Domain: $1-x \geq 0 \implies x \leq 1 \implies \{x \in \mathbb{R}: x \leq 1\}$. \\
$F(-3)=\sqrt{4}=2$, $F(0)=\sqrt{1}=1$, $F\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $F(1)=\sqrt{0}=0$, $F(2)$ is undefined.

\subsection*{One-One Function}

Image description: A Venn diagram with two sets $A$ and $B$, with arrows from distinct elements of $A$ to distinct elements of $B$, illustrating a one-one function.

\subsection*{Definition 10 (One-One Function)}
A function $f$ is called one-one function if images of the elements in its domain always are distinct under that function. So, if $x_1, x_2 \in \text{dom } f$ and $x_1 \neq x_2$ then $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$.

From the above definition we see that, a function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is called one-one function, if and only if $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ then $x_1=x_2$, where $x_1, x_2 \in A$.

\textbf{Example 30.} Is the function $f(x)=3x+5$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$ a one-one function?

solution: If $f(a)=f(b)$, then $3a+5=3b+5 \implies a=b$. Thus, $f$ is one-one.

\textbf{Example 31.} Show that the function, $F: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $F(x)=x^2$ is not one-one.

solution: For $x_1=-1$, $x_2=1$, $F(-1)=1$, $F(1)=1$. Since $x_1 \neq x_2$ but $F(x_1)=F(x_2)$, $F$ is not one-one.

\subsection*{Observation}
Inverse relation of a function may not be a function.

\textbf{Example 32.} Find out for the function $f(x)=\frac{x}{x-2}$, $x \neq 2$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f(5)$
    \item $f^{-1}(2)$
\end{enumerate}

solution: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f(5)=\frac{5}{5-2}=\frac{5}{3}$.
    \item Let $f^{-1}(2)=a$, so $f(a)=2 \implies \frac{a}{a-2}=2 \implies a=4$. Thus, $f^{-1}(2)=4$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example 33.} $f(x)=3x+1$, $0 \leq x \leq 2$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the range of $f$.
    \item Show that $f$ is a one-one function.
    \item Determine $f^{-1}$ and draw the graph of $f$ and $f^{-1}$.
\end{enumerate}

solution: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f(0)=1$, $f(2)=7$. Range: $\{y: 1 \leq y \leq 7\}$.
    \item If $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$, then $3x_1+1=3x_2+1 \implies x_1=x_2$. Thus, $f$ is one-one.
    \item $y=3x+1 \implies x=\frac{y-1}{3}$. Thus, $f^{-1}(x)=\frac{x-1}{3}$, $1 \leq x \leq 7$.

    Image description: A graph with $x$-axis from 0 to 7 and $y$-axis from 0 to 7. The line $y=3x+1$ (from $(0,1)$ to $(2,7)$) represents $f$, and the line $y=\frac{x-1}{3}$ (from $(1,0)$ to $(7,2)$) represents $f^{-1}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Onto Function}

Image description: A diagram showing a function $f$ from $A=\{1,2,3\}$ to $B=\{5,7,9\}$, with arrows $1 \rightarrow 5$, $2 \rightarrow 7$, $3 \rightarrow 9$, indicating an onto function.

\subsection*{Definition 11 (Onto Function)}
A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ will be called the onto function if for every $b \in B$, there exists $a \in A$ such that $f(a)=b$. So, $B=\text{range } f$.

\textbf{Example 34.} If two functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are defined by $f(x)=x+5$ and $g(x)=x-5$ respectively, then show that, $f$ is an inverse function of $g$.

solution: $f$ is one-one: $f(x_1)=f(x_2) \implies x_1+5=x_2+5 \implies x_1=x_2$. $f$ is onto: For $y \in \mathbb{R}$, $x=y-5$ satisfies $f(x)=y$. Thus, $f^{-1}(x)=x-5=g(x)$, so $f^{-1}=g$.

\subsection*{Graphs of Relations and Functions}
Graphs are useful geometrical presentations of functions. To draw the graph of $y=f(x)$, we draw a pair of perpendicular bisectors $XOX^{\prime}$ and $YOY^{\prime}$ through a point $O$. $O$ is called the origin, $XOX^{\prime}$ is called the x-axis while $YOY^{\prime}$ is called the y-axis.
For drawing the graph of $y=f(x)$, pairs of values of independent variable $x$ and dependent variable $y$ need to be tabulated between an interval $a \leq x \leq b$. Then the limited amount of points of the tabulation are placed on the plane $xy$. By joining the obtained points with a straight line or a curved line, we can get the graph of function $y=f(x)$. In the Mathematics book of class 9-10, the initial concepts about graphs have been imparted. Here, the linear function, the quadratic function and the construction of the graphs of the circle have been discussed.

\subsection*{Linear Functions}
The general form of linear function is $f(x)=mx+b$ where, $m$ and $b$ are real numbers. The graph of this function is a line whose slope is $m$ and the intercept of $y$ axis is $b$.
Here, let $m=3$ and $b=2$. So, we can have the function $f(x)=3x+2$.

From the described function, we get following related values of $x$ and $y$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
$x$ & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline
$y$ & -4 & -1 & 2 & 5 & 8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Image description: A graph with a straight line representing $y=3x+2$, plotted through points $(-2,-4)$, $(-1,-1)$, $(0,2)$, $(1,5)$, $(2,8)$, with slope 3 and y-intercept 2.

\subsection*{Quadratic Function}
A quadratic function is a function which can be described by the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ where $a, b$ and $c$ are real numbers and $a \neq 0$. Suppose, in this function $a=1$, $b=-4$, $c=-1$. So $y=ax^2+bx+c$ can be written as $y=x^2-4x-1$. We can get the related values of $x$ and $y$ from the described function which is shown in the following table.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
$x$ & $x^2-4x-1$ & $y$ \\
\hline
-1 & $(-1)^2-4(-1)-1$ & 4 \\
0 & $(0)^2-4(0)-1$ & -1 \\
1 & $(1)^2-4(1)-1$ & -4 \\
2 & $(2)^2-4(2)-1$ & -5 \\
3 & $(3)^2-4(3)-1$ & -4 \\
4 & $(4)^2-4(4)-1$ & -1 \\
5 & $(5)^2-4(5)-1$ & 4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Image description: A graph of the quadratic function $y=x^2-4x-1$, forming a parabola with vertex at $(2,-5)$, plotted through points $(-1,4)$, $(0,-1)$, $(1,-4)$, $(2,-5)$, $(3,-4)$, $(4,-1)$, $(5,4)$.

This is the required graph of the quadratic function. Let's observe some general properties of this quadratic function.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The graph is paraboloid shaped.
    \item Symmetric point may be found about $y$ axis or parallel to the $y$ axis.
    \item The value of the function will be maximum or minimum at a certain point.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Graph of a Circle}
Noted that $p, q$ and $r$ are constants and if $r \neq 0$ then in $\mathbb{R}$, the graph of a relation $S=\{(x, y): (x-p)^2+(y-q)^2=r^2\}$ is a circle whose centre is the point $(p, q)$ and radius is $r$ (see the Mathematics book of class 9-10). In the graph paper, by plotting the point $(p, q)$ as centre and taking $r$ as radius we can draw a circle which will make the graph.

\textbf{Remark:} If the solution set of a relation is infinite, the known system of drawing its graph is to plot sufficient numbers of representative points of solution in the graph paper and then to join them, so that the graph of the relation can be clear. But if the graph of relation is a circle, using compass will make the work easier and beautiful, so we use the latter means.

\textbf{Example 35.} $S=\{(x, y): x^2+y^2=16\}$

solution: The graph of $S$ is a circle $x^2+y^2=4^2$, with centre $(0,0)$ and radius $r=4$.

Image description: A graph showing a circle centered at the origin $(0,0)$ with radius 4, defined by the equation $x^2+y^2=16$.
