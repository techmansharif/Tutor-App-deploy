% Part 1: Triangle Constructions with Base and Angle Data
\part{Triangle Constructions with Base and Angle Data}

% Construction 1
\subsection*{Construction 1: Base, Angle Adjoining the Base, and Height}
Suppose, the base $a$, the height $h$ and an angle $x$ adjoining the base are given. The triangle needs to be drawn.

Image description: A diagram showing a ray $BD$ with a segment $BC$ of length $a$ marked as the base. A perpendicular line from $B$ to point $M$ at height $h$ above $BC$ is drawn, and a line $MN$ parallel to $BC$ passes through $M$. An angle $x$ at $B$ is formed by ray $BE$, which intersects $MN$ at point $A$. Lines $AB$ and $AC$ form triangle $ABC$.

Drawing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] Cut the part $BC = a$ from any ray $BD$.
    \[
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    B & a & C \quad D
    \end{array}
    \]
    \item[Step 2.] Draw at $B$ the perpendicular
    \item[Step 3.] Draw through the point $M$, the line $MN \parallel BC$.
    \item[Step 4.] Again construct $\angle CBE$ equal to the given $\angle x$ at the point $B$. The line segment $BE$ intersects $MN$ at $A$.
    \item[Step 5.] Join $A$ and $C$. Then $ABC$ is the desired triangle.
\end{enumerate}

Proof: As $MN \parallel BC$ (As per the construction). $\therefore$ The height of $\triangle ABC$ is $BM = h$. Again $BC = a$ and $\angle ABC = \angle x$. $\therefore \triangle ABC$ is the desired triangle.

Analysis: The base and an angle adjoining the base are given. So we need to cut off a portion from a ray equal to the base and at an end-point we draw an angle equal to the given angle. Then we draw the perpendicular at that end point of the base and cut off a portion equal to the height. The point where the other arm of this angle intersects the line parallel to the base as the given height, is the third vertex of the desired triangle.

% Construction 2
\subsection*{Construction 2: Base, Vertical Angle, and Sum of Other Two Sides}
Let $a$ be the base, $s$ be the sum of the other two sides and $x$ be the vertical angle. The triangle needs to be constructed.

Image description: A diagram showing a ray $DE$ with segment $DB = s$ marked. At point $D$, an angle $\angle BDF = \frac{1}{2}x$ is drawn along line $DF$. A circle centered at $B$ with radius $a$ intersects $DF$ at points $C$ and $C'$. Rays from $C$ and $C'$ form angles equal to $\angle BDF$, intersecting $BD$ at points $A$ and $A'$, forming triangles $ABC$ and $A'BC'$.

Drawing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] Cut the segment $DB = s$ from any ray $DE$.
    \item[Step 2.] At $D$ of the line $DB$, draw
    \[
    \angle BDF = \frac{1}{2} \angle x.
    \]
    \item[Step 3.] Taking $B$ as centre, draw a segment of circle of radius $a$; let it intersect $DF$ at $C$ and $C'$. Join $B, C$ and $B, C'$.
    \item[Step 4.] At the point $C$, draw $\angle BDF$ equal to $\angle DCA$ and at $C'$, draw $\angle BDF$ equal to $\angle DC'A'$. Let $CA$ and $C'A'$ intersect $BD$ at $A$ and $A'$ respectively. Then both the triangles $ABC$ and $A'BC'$ are the required triangle.
\end{enumerate}

Proof: Since $\angle ACD = \angle ADC = \angle A'C'D = \frac{1}{2} \angle x$ (by construction)
\begin{align*}
\therefore \angle BAC &= \angle ADC + \angle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \angle x + \frac{1}{2} \angle x = \angle x \\
\therefore \angle BA'C' &= \angle A'DC' + \angle A'C'D = \frac{1}{2} \angle x + \frac{1}{2} \angle x = \angle x \\
\text{and } AC &= AD, A'C' = A'D
\end{align*}
So, in the triangle $ABC$,
\[
\angle BAC = \angle x, BC = a \text{ and } CA + AB = DA + AB = DB = s
\]
$\therefore \triangle ABC$ is the required triangle.
Again, in the triangle $A'BC'$,
\[
\angle BA'C' = \angle x, BC' = a \text{ and } C'A' + A'B = DA' + A'B = DB = s
\]
$\therefore \triangle A'BC'$ is the other required triangle.

% Construction 3
\subsection*{Construction 3: Base, Vertical Angle, and Difference of Other Two Sides}
Let $a$ be the base. Given that $d$ is the difference of the other two sides and $x$ is the vertical angle. The triangle needs to be constructed.

Image description: A diagram showing a ray $BD$ with segment $BP = d$ marked. At point $P$, an angle $\angle DPM$ equal to half the supplementary angle of $x$ is drawn along line $PM$. A circle centered at $B$ with radius $a$ intersects $PM$ at point $C$. A line from $C$ forming $\angle DPC = \angle PCA$ intersects $BD$ at $A$, forming triangle $ABC$.

Drawing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] Cut the segment $BP = d$ from any ray $BD$.
    \[
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    B & d & P
    \end{array}
    \]
    \item[Step 2.] At $P$, draw $\angle DPM$, equal to the half of the supplementary angle of $\angle x$.
    \item[Step 3.] Taking $B$ as centre, all arc with the radius $a$ of the circle; let the arc equal to the radius intersect the straight line $PM$ at the point $C$. Join $B$ and $C$.
    \item[Step 4.] Again, at the point $C$, draw $\angle DPC = \angle PCA$ so that the line segment $CA$ intersect $BD$ at $A$. Then $ABC$ is the required triangle.
\end{enumerate}

Proof: $\angle APC = \angle ACP$
\[
\therefore AP = AC
\]
\[
\therefore AB - AC = AB - AP = d
\]
Again $\angle APC = \angle ACP$ is half of the supplementary angle of $\angle x$.
\[
\therefore \angle APC + \angle ACP = \text{Supplementary of } \angle x = \text{external } \angle CAD = \text{supplementary angle of } \angle CAB
\]
\[
\therefore \angle A = \angle CAB = \angle x
\]
$\therefore ABC$ is the required triangle.

% Example 1
\subsection*{Example 1}
Given that the length of the base of a triangle is 5 cm., angle adjoining the base is $60^\circ$ and the sum of the lengths of the two other sides is 7 cm. Construct the triangle.

solution: It is given that the base $BC = 5$ cm., the sum of the lengths of the two other sides $AB + AC = 7$ cm. and $\angle ABC = 60^\circ$. Construct $\triangle ABC$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] From any ray $BX$, cut off $BC = 5$ cm.
    \item[Step 2.] Draw $\angle XBY = 60^\circ$.
    \item[Step 3.] From the ray $BY$, cut $BD = 7$ cm.
    \item[Step 4.] Join $C, D$.
    \item[Step 5.] Draw the perpendicular bisector of $CD$, let it intersect $BD$ at the point $A$.
    \item[Step 6.] Join $A, C$, Then $ABC$ is the required triangle.
\end{enumerate}

Image description: A diagram showing a ray $BX$ with segment $BC = 5$ cm marked as the base. An angle $\angle XBY = 60^\circ$ is drawn at $B$, forming ray $BY$. Point $D$ is on $BY$ such that $BD = 7$ cm. Line $CD$ is drawn, and its perpendicular bisector intersects $BD$ at $A$. Lines $AB$ and $AC$ form triangle $ABC$.

Note: Since $AL$ is the perpendicular bisector of $CD$, $AD = AC$.
Then $BD = BA + AD = BA + AC = 7$ cm.

% Example 2
\subsection*{Example 2}
The length of the base of a triangle is 7.5 cm., an angle adjoining the base is $45^\circ$ and the difference of the lengths of the other two sides is 2.5 cm. Construct the triangle.

solution: Given that the base $BC = 7.5$ cm, difference of the other two sides $AB - AC$ or $AC - AB = 2.5$ cm. and the angle adjoining the base $45^\circ$. Construct the triangle. Here we will see the steps in the Construction of $AB - AC = 2.5$ cm. [Draw the triangle taking $AC - AB = 2.5$ cm.]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] From any ray $BX$ cut $BC = 7.5$ cm.
    \item[Step 2.] Draw $\angle YBC = 45^\circ$.
    \item[Step 3.] From the ray $BY$, cut $BD = 2.5$ cm.
    \item[Step 4.] Join $C, D$.
    \item[Step 5.] Draw the perpendicular bisector $RS$ of $CD$; let it intersect $BY$ at the point $A$.
    \item[Step 6.] Join $A$ and $C$. Then $ABC$ is the required triangle.
\end{enumerate}

Image description: A diagram showing a ray $BX$ with segment $BC = 7.5$ cm as the base. An angle $\angle YBC = 45^\circ$ is drawn at $B$, forming ray $BY$. Point $D$ is on $BY$ such that $BD = 2.5$ cm. Line $CD$ is drawn, and its perpendicular bisector $RS$ intersects $BY$ at $A$. Lines $AB$ and $AC$ form triangle $ABC$.

% Construction 4
\subsection*{Construction 4: Height, Median on the Base, and Angle Adjoining the Base}
Let $h$ be the height, $d$ be the median on the base and $\angle x$ be an angle adjoining to the base of the triangle. The triangle needs to be constructed.

Image description: A diagram showing a line $BE$ with an angle $\angle EBP = x$ at $B$. A perpendicular $BQ$ from $B$ to $BE$ has point $M$ at height $h$. A line $MN$ parallel to $BE$ intersects $BP$ at $A$. A circle centered at $A$ with radius $d$ intersects $BE$ at $D$, and $DC = BD$ on $BE$. Lines $AB$ and $AC$ form triangle $ABC$.

Drawing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] Draw $BE$ and draw $\angle EBP$ equal to $\angle x$ at $B$.
    \item[Step 2.] At the point $B$, draw $BQ$ perpendicular on the line $BE$.
    \item[Step 3.] From $BQ$, cut $BM$ equal to the height $h$.
    \item[Step 4.] At the point $M$, draw the line $MN \parallel BE$ which intersects $BP$ at the point $A$.
    \item[Step 5.] Taking $A$ as centre, draw an arc with the radius equal to the median $d$; let the arc intersect $BE$ at the point $D$.
    \item[Step 6.] From $BE$, cut the segment $DC = BD$. Join $A$ and $C$.
\end{enumerate}
Then $\triangle ABC$ is the required triangle.

Proof: $BD = DC \therefore D$ is the middle point of $BC$.
Join $A, D, \therefore AD = d = \text{the median drawn on the base, i.e., the base } BC$.
$MN$ and $BE$ are parallel line. Therefore the height of the $\triangle ABC$ is $BM = h$.
Again, $\angle ABC = \angle x = \text{adjacent to the given length of the median}$.
$\therefore ABC$ is the required triangle.

Remark: We can get two triangle in many cases depending on $\angle x$. Besides, the triangle can not be drawn if the length of the median is less then height.

% Construction 5
\subsection*{Construction 5: Circle Passing Through Two Points with Center on a Line}
$A$ and $B$ are the two fixed points, $PQ$ is a fixed straight line. Construct such a circle which passes through the points $A$ and $B$ and whose centre lies on the straight line $PQ$.

Image description: A diagram showing points $A$ and $B$ connected by line $AB$, with a straight line $PQ$. The perpendicular bisector $CD$ of $AB$ intersects $PQ$ at point $O$. A circle centered at $O$ with radius $OA$ passes through $A$ and $B$, labeled as $ABNM$.

Drawing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] Join $A, B$.
    \item[Step 2.] Construct the perpendicular bisector $CD$ of line segment $AB$.
    \item[Step 3.] The line segment $CD$ intersects the line $PQ$ at the point $O$.
    \item[Step 4.] Taking $O$ as centre draw the circle of radius $OA$ or $OB$, $ABNM$ is the desired circle.
\end{enumerate}

Proof: The line segment $CD$ is perpendicular bisector of $AB$. Therefore, any point on $CD$ is of equal distance from $A$ and $B$. By construction, the point $O$ lies on $CD$ and $PQ$. Again, since $OA$ and $OB$ are equal so the circle drawn at the centre $O$ with the radius $OA$ or $OB$ will pass through the points $A$ and $B$ and the centre $O$ will lie on the line segment $PQ$. The circle drawn with $O$ as centre and $OA$ or $OB$ is the required circle.

% Construction 8
\subsection*{Construction 8: Circle Touching a Point on a Line and Passing Through a Point}
Suppose $A$ is a definite point on the straight line $AB$ and $P$ be a point not lying on the line $AB$. To draw a circle which touches the line $AB$ at $A$ passes through the point $P$.

Image description: A diagram showing a straight line $AB$ with point $A$ on it and point $P$ not on the line. A perpendicular $AC$ is drawn at $A$ to $AB$. Line $PA$ has a perpendicular bisector $QR$, intersecting $AC$ at $O$. A circle centered at $O$ with radius $OA$, labeled $APS$, passes through $A$ and $P$ and touches $AB$ at $A$.

Drawing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] Draw the perpendicular $AC$ at the point $A$ on the line $AB$.
    \item[Step 2.] Join $P, A$ and construct its perpendicular bisector $QR$.
    \item[Step 3.] The lines $QR$ and $AC$ intersect at $O$.
    \item[Step 4.] Taking $O$ as centre draw the circle $APS$ with radius $OA$. Then $APS$ is the required circle.
\end{enumerate}

Proof: Join $O, P$. The point $O$ lies on $QR$ that is perpendicular bisector of $AP$.
\[
\therefore OA = OP.
\]
$\therefore$ The circle with centre $O$ and radius $OA$ passes through the points $P$.
Again, $OA$ passing through $A$ is a perpendicular to the line $AB$.
$\therefore$ So the circle touches line $AB$ at the point $A$.
$\therefore$ Taking $O$ as the centre and $OA$ as the radius, the drawn circle is the required circle.

Analysis: Since the circle is required to touch a definite line at a definite point, so, that line has to be tangent to the circle at that definite point and this tangent has to be the diameter of the circle. Since the definite point on the line and the definite external point both are required to lie on the circle, the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the two points will pass through the centre. So the centre is the point of intersection of this bisector with the perpendicular erected at the point given on the definite line.

% Construction 6
\subsection*{Construction 6: Circle with Given Radius Passing Through Two Points}
$A$ and $B$ are the definite points and $r$ is the length of the definite line segments. Construct such a circle which passes through $A$ and $B$ and whose radius is equal to $r$.

Image description: A diagram showing points $A$ and $B$ connected by line $AB$. Two circles centered at $A$ and $B$ with radius $r$ intersect at points $P$ and $Q$ on opposite sides of $AB$. Two circles, one centered at $P$ with radius $PA$ (labeled $ABC$) and another at $Q$ with radius $QA$ (labeled $ABD$), pass through $A$ and $B$.

Drawing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] Join $A$ and $B$.
    \item[Step 2.] Draw two segments of the two circles of radius by centering $A$ and $B$ and taking $r$ as radius on both sides of the line $AB$. The two pairs of segments of the two circles intersect at $P$ and $Q$ on the two sides of the line $AB$ respectively.
    \item[Step 3.] Taking $P$ as centre and $PA$ as radius, draw the circle $ABC$.
    \item[Step 4.] Again taking $Q$ as centre and $QA$ as radius, draw the circle $ABD$.
    \item[Step 5.] Then each of $ABC$ and $ABD$ is the required circle.
\end{enumerate}

Proof: $PA = PB = r$. The drawn circle $ABC$ with centre $P$ and radius $PA$ or $PB$ that passes through the points $A$ and $B$ and its radius is $PA = r$.
Again $QA = QB = r$. The drawn circle $ABD$ with centre $Q$ and radius $QA$ or $QB$ passes through the points $A$ and $B$ and its radius is $QA = r$.
$\therefore$ Each of the two circles $ABC$ and $ABD$ is the required circle.

% Construction 7
\subsection*{Construction 7: Circle Touching a Point on Another Circle and Passing Through a Point}
Let a circle be given with centre $C$, $P$ be a definite point on that circle and $Q$ be a definite point outside that circle. Draw a circle which touches the circle at $P$ and passes through the point $Q$.

Image description: A diagram showing a circle with center $C$ and point $P$ on its circumference. Point $Q$ is outside the circle. Line $PQ$ has a perpendicular bisector $AB$, and line $CP$ extended intersects $AB$ at $O$. A circle centered at $O$ with radius $OP$, labeled $PQR$, passes through $P$ and $Q$ and touches the original circle at $P$.

Drawing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] Join $P, Q$.
    \item[Step 2.] Draw the perpendicular bisector $AB$ of $PQ$.
    \item[Step 3.] Join $C, P$.
    \item[Step 4.] Extended line segment $CP$ intersects $AB$ at the point $O$.
    \item[Step 5.] Taking $O$ as centre, draw the circle with radius equal to $OP$. The resulting circle $PQR$ is the required circle.
\end{enumerate}

Proof: Join $O, Q$. The line segment $AB$ or the line segment $OB$ is the perpendicular bisector of $PQ$. $\therefore OP = OQ$.

So the circle of radius $OP$ and centre $O$ will pass through $Q$.
Again the point $P$ lies on the given circle and on the constructed circle and also the line joining the centres of the two circles. i.e. the two circles intersect at the point $P$. So the two circles touch each other at $P$.

Therefore, the circle drawn with $O$ as the centre and $OP$ as the radius is the required circle.

% Example 3
\subsection*{Example 3}
Given, a point at a distance of 5 cm. from the centre of a circle of radius 2 cm. Determine the distance of the two tangents.

solution: Draw a circle with the centre at $O$ and 2 cm. Fix a point $P$ at a distance of 5 cm. from $O$. We need to construct the two tangents to the circle for determining their lengths
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[Step 1.] Bisect the line $OP$. Let $M$ be the bisector point.
    \item[Step 2.] Draw the circle with centre at $M$ and the radius $OM$ that intersects the circle with the centre $O$ at the points $Q$ and $R$.
    \item[Step 3.] Join $P, Q$ and $P, R$. Then $PQ$ and $PR$ are the two required tangents.
\end{enumerate}
Now measuring $PQ$ and $PR$ we find $PQ = PR = 4.6$ cm.

Image description: A diagram showing a circle centered at $O$ with radius 2 cm. Point $P$ is 5 cm from $O$. Line $OP$ is bisected at $M$, and a circle centered at $M$ with radius $OM$ intersects the original circle at points $Q$ and $R$. Lines $PQ$ and $PR$ are tangents from $P$ to the circle at $Q$ and $R$.
