% Title and Introduction
\section*{Chapter 7: Infinite Series}

Sequence and finite series are discussed in detail in the General Mathematics Book of Class IX-X. There is a direct relationship between sequence and infinite series. Infinite series can be obtained after assigning plus signs before the terms of a sequence. Infinite series will be discussed in this chapter.

After completing the chapter, the students will be able to -
\begin{itemize}
    \item explain the idea of a sequence;
    \item identify the infinite series;
    \item explain the condition of existing the sum of an infinite geometric series;
    \item sum of an infinite geometric series;
    \item transform a recurring decimal number into an infinite geometric series and express in fraction.
\end{itemize}

% Sequences
\subsection*{Sequences}

In the relationships illustrated below, every natural number $n$ is related to its square $n^2$; that is, the set of square numbers $\{1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots\}$ is obtained for the set of natural numbers $N = \{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}$ under a certain rule. This set of arranged sequence numbers is a sequence. When some numbers are arranged successively under a definite rule such that the relationship between any two successive terms is known, then the set of numbers arranged in this way is called a sequence.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & $\cdots$ & $n$ & $\cdots$ \\
\hline
$\downarrow$ & $\downarrow$ & $\downarrow$ & $\downarrow$ & & $\downarrow$ & \\
\hline
1 & 4 & 9 & 16 & $\cdots$ & $n^2$ & $\cdots$ \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Image description: A table showing a mapping from natural numbers to their squares. The top row lists natural numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots, n, \ldots$, and the bottom row lists their corresponding squares $1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots, n^2, \ldots$. Arrows point from each number in the top row to its square in the bottom row.

The relationship shown above is called a function and is written as $f(n) = n^2$. The general term of this sequence is $n^2$. The number of terms of any sequence is infinite. The way to write the sequence in terms of the general term is $\left\{n^2\right\}, n = 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$ or, $\left\{n^2\right\}_{n=1}^{+\infty}$ or just, $\left\{n^2\right\}$. The first number of a sequence is called the first term, the second number of a sequence is called the second term, and so on. In the above sequence $1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots$, first term $= 1$, second term $= 4$, and so on. Four more examples of sequences are given below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2^3}, \frac{1}{2^4}, \ldots, \frac{1}{2^n}, \ldots$
    \item $3, 1, -1, -3, \ldots, (5 - 2 n), \ldots$
    \item $1, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{7}, \ldots, \frac{n}{2 n - 1}, \ldots$
    \item $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{17}, \ldots, \frac{1}{n^2 + 1}, \ldots$
\end{enumerate}

% Series
\subsection*{Series}

If the terms of a sequence are connected successively by a '$+$' sign, then a series is formed. As an example, $1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + \ldots$ is a series. Then again, $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \ldots$ is another series. The ratio between two successive terms of this series is the same. This type of series is called Geometric Series. The characteristics of a series depend on the relationship between two consecutive terms of it. For example, in case of Arithmetic Series, the difference between two consecutive terms is constant.

Depending on the number of terms, series can be divided into two classes: 1) Finite series 2) Infinite series. Finite series are discussed in the General Mathematics Book of Class IX-X. Infinite series will be discussed here.

% Part 2: Partial Sums
\part{Partial Sums}

% Partial Sum of Infinite Series
\subsection*{Partial Sum of Infinite Series}

Let $u_1 + u_2 + u_3 + \ldots + u_n + \ldots$ be an infinite series. Then its:
1st partial sum is $S_1 = u_1$
2nd partial sum is $S_2 = u_1 + u_2$
3rd partial sum is $S_3 = u_1 + u_2 + u_3$
$\therefore$ The $n$-th partial sum is $S_n = u_1 + u_2 + u_3 + \ldots + u_n$
That is, the $n$-th partial sum of an infinite series is the sum of the first $n$ number of terms of the series, where $n \in N$.

\textbf{Example 1.} Find the partial sum of the following two series:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots$
    \item $1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \ldots$
\end{enumerate}

solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First term of the series $a = 1$ and common difference is $d = 1$. Therefore, the given series is an arithmetic progression.
    Sum of the first $n$ terms of the arithmetic series is
    \[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \{2 a + (n - 1) d\} = \frac{n}{2} \{2 \cdot 1 + (n - 1) \cdot 1\} \]
    So $S_n = \frac{n}{2} \{2 + n - 1\} = \frac{n (n + 1)}{2}$
    In the above equation, putting different values of $n$ we get,
    \[ \begin{aligned}
    S_{10} &= \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = 55 \\
    S_{1000} &= \frac{1000 \times 1001}{2} = 500500 \\
    S_{100000} &= \frac{100000 \times 100001}{2} = 5000050000
    \end{aligned} \]
    Here as $n$ increases, the value of $S_n$ becomes larger.
    Therefore, the given infinite series has no sum.

    \item $1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \ldots$ is the given infinite series. Its
    1st partial sum $S_1 = 1$
    2nd partial sum $S_2 = 1 - 1 = 0$
    3rd partial sum $S_3 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1$
    4th partial sum $S_4 = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = 0$
    In the above example it can be seen that, for odd $n$, the $n$-th partial sum $S_n = 1$ and for even $n$, the $n$-th partial sum $S_n = 0$.
    Therefore, it is observed that there is no specific number which is the sum of this series.
\end{enumerate}

% Infinite Series
\subsection*{Infinite Series}

If $u_1, u_2, u_3, \ldots, u_n, \ldots$ is a sequence of real numbers, then $u_1 + u_2 + u_3 + \ldots + u_n + \ldots$ is called an infinite series of real numbers. $u_n$ is called the $n$-th term of this series.

% Part 4: Infinite Geometric Series
\part{Infinite Geometric Series}

% Sum of Infinite Geometric Series
\subsection*{Sum of Infinite Geometric Series}

$a + a r + a r^2 + a r^3 + \ldots$ is a geometric series. Its first term is $a$ and common ratio is $r$.

Therefore, the $n$-th term of the series $= a r^{n - 1}$, where $n \in N$
Now, if $r \neq 1$ then the partial sum of this series up to $n$-th term is
\[ \begin{aligned}
S_n &= a + a r + a r^2 + a r^3 + \ldots + a r^{n - 1} \\
S_n &= a \cdot \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \quad \text{ when } r > 1 \text{ and } S_n = a \cdot \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \quad \text{ when } r < 1
\end{aligned} \]
We observe:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the case of $|r| < 1$, that is $-1 < r < 1$, if the value of $n$ increases (that is, when $n \to \infty$) then the value of $|r^n|$ decreases. Thus making $n$ sufficiently large, the value can be decreased indefinitely, that is, $|r^n|$ approaches 0. So, the limiting value of $|r^n|$ becomes 0.
    Consequently, the limiting value of $S_n, S_n = \frac{a (1 - r^n)}{1 - r} = \frac{a}{1 - r} - \frac{a r^n}{1 - r} = \frac{a}{1 - r}$
    Therefore, the sum of the infinite series $S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1 - r}$
    \item In the case of $|r| > 1$, that is $r > 1$ or $r < -1$, if the value of $n$ increases then the value of $|r^n|$ increases and making $n$ sufficiently large the value of $|r^n|$ can be increased indefinitely. From this it is clear that there does not exist a finite number $S$ which can be considered as the limiting value of $S_n$.
    So, in this case, sum of the infinite series does not exist.
    \item If $r = -1$, then the limiting value of $S_n$ cannot be found. Because, if $n$ is even then $(-1)^n = 1$ and if $n$ is odd, then $(-1)^n = -1$. In this case the series will be, $a - a + a - a + a - a + \ldots$.
    So, sum of this infinite series does not exist.
    \item In case of $r = 1$, limiting value of $S_n$ cannot be found as well. Because, in that case the series will be $a + a + a + a + \ldots$ ($n$ numbered). That means, $S_n = n a$ which can be increased with the increasing of $n$.
    So, sum of this infinite series does not exist.
\end{enumerate}

If $|r| < 1$, that is $-1 < r < 1$, then the sum of the infinite series $a + a r + a r^2 + \ldots, S = \frac{a}{1 - r}$. For other values of $r$, the sum of the series does not exist.

Remark: The sum of the infinite geometric series (if exists) is sometimes denoted by $S_{\infty}$ and it is called the sum of the series up to infinity. That is, $a + a r + a r^2 + a r^3 + \ldots$ up to infinity, $S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1 - r}$, when $|r| < 1$.

\textbf{Example 2.} Find the sum (if it exists) of each of the following infinite geometric series:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{3^4} + \ldots$
    \item $1 + 0.1 + 0.01 + 0.001 + \ldots$
    \item $1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{4} + \ldots$
\end{enumerate}

solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Here, the first term of the series, $a = \frac{1}{3}$ and common ratio, $r = \frac{\frac{1}{3^2}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{3} < 1$
    \[ \therefore \text{The sum to infinity of the series is, } S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \]

    \item The first term of the series, $a = 1$ and common ratio, $r = \frac{0.1}{1} = \frac{1}{10} < 1$
    \[ \therefore \text{The sum to infinity of the series is, } S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{10}} = \frac{10}{9} = 1 \frac{1}{9} \]

    \item Here, the first term of the series, $a = 1$ and common ratio, $r = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} < 1$
    \[ \therefore \text{The sum to infinity of the series is, } S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} - 1} = 3.414 \text{ (approx.)} \]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example 4.} $\frac{1}{2 x + 1} + \frac{1}{(2 x + 1)^2} + \frac{1}{(2 x + 1)^3} + \ldots$ is an infinite geometric series.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $x = 1$, then determine the common ratio of the series.
    \item If $x = \frac{3}{2}$, then determine the 5th term and sum up to the 10th term of the series.
    \item If the series has sum to infinity, then what condition should be imposed upon $x$? Determine that sum.
\end{enumerate}

solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given that, $\frac{1}{2 x + 1} + \frac{1}{(2 x + 1)^2} + \frac{1}{(2 x + 1)^3} + \ldots$ is an infinite geometric series,
    \[ \begin{aligned}
    \text{If } x = 1, \text{ the series } &= \frac{1}{2 \cdot 1 + 1} + \frac{1}{(2 \cdot 1 + 1)^2} + \frac{1}{(2 \cdot 1 + 1)^3} + \ldots \\
    &= \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \ldots
    \end{aligned} \]
    Its common ratio, $r = \frac{\frac{1}{3^2}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{3}$

    \item Given that, $\frac{1}{2 x + 1} + \frac{1}{(2 x + 1)^2} + \frac{1}{(2 x + 1)^3} + \ldots$
    \[ \begin{aligned}
    \text{If } x = \frac{3}{2}, \text{ the series } &= \frac{1}{2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} + 1} + \frac{1}{\left(2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} + 1\right)^2} + \frac{1}{\left(2 \cdot \frac{3}{2} + 1\right)^3} + \ldots \\
    &= \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \frac{1}{4^3} + \ldots
    \end{aligned} \]
    The first term of the series, $a = \frac{1}{4}$, common ratio, $r = \frac{\frac{1}{4^2}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{4} < 1$
    \[ \therefore \text{5th term of the series } = a r^{5 - 1} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{5 - 1} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^5 = \frac{1}{4^5} \]
    Sum of first 10 terms of the series $= \frac{a (1 - r^n)}{1 - r} \quad [n = 10]$
    \[ = \frac{\frac{1}{4} \left\{1 - \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{10}\right\}}{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} \left(1 - \frac{1}{4^{10}}\right)}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{3} \left(1 - \frac{1}{4^{10}}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \left(1 - \frac{1}{4^{10}}\right) \]

    \item First term of the series, $a = \frac{1}{2 x + 1}$, Common ratio, $r = \frac{\frac{1}{(2 x + 1)^2}}{\frac{1}{2 x + 1}} = \frac{1}{2 x + 1}$
    Here, $\frac{1}{2 x + 1} \neq 0$, So, $\frac{1}{2 x + 1} > 0$ or $\frac{1}{2 x + 1} < 0 \cdots (1)$
    Now, the series will have sum to infinity if, $|r| < 1$ that is $\left|\frac{1}{2 x + 1}\right| < 1 \cdots (2)$
    When condition of (1) $\frac{1}{2 x + 1} > 0$ is true, that is $2 x + 1 > 0$ [multiplicative reciprocal has the same sign] then putting it in (2), we get $\frac{1}{2 x + 1} < 1$
    Now, multiplying both sides with positive number $2 x + 1$ will keep the inequality sign same
    that is $1 < 2 x + 1$, or, $1 - 1 < 2 x$, or, $0 < 2 x$, or, $2 x > 0$ or, $x > 0$
    When condition of $\frac{1}{2 x + 1} < 0$ is true, that is $2 x + 1 < 0$ [then putting it in (2), we get $-\frac{1}{2 x + 1} < 1$
    Now if we multiply both sides with negative number $2 x + 1$, then the inequality sign will reverse
    that is $-1 > 2 x + 1$, or, $-1 - 1 > 2 x$, or, $-2 > 2 x$, or, $-1 > x$, or, $x < -1$
    $\therefore$ the condition is $x < -1$ or, $x > 0$
    So the sum to infinity of the series, $S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{\frac{1}{2 x + 1}}{1 - \frac{1}{2 x + 1}}$
    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $(2 x + 1), S_{\infty} = \frac{1}{2 x + 1 - 1} = \frac{1}{2 x}$

\subsection*{Transformation of Repeating (or Recurring) Decimals in Rational Fractions}

\textbf{Example 3.} Express in rational fractions of the following repeating decimals:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $0.5$
    \item $0.12$
    \item $1.231$
\end{enumerate}

solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $0.5 = 0.555 \ldots = 0.5 + 0.05 + 0.005 + \ldots$
    This infinite geometric series goes with the first term, $a = 0.5$ and common ratio, $r = \frac{0.05}{0.5} = 0.1$
    \[ \therefore 0.5 = \frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{0.5}{1 - (0.1)} = \frac{0.5}{0.9} = \frac{5}{9} \]

    \item $0.12 = 0.12121212 \ldots = 0.12 + 0.0012 + 0.000012 + \ldots$
    The first term of this infinite geometric series, $a = 0.12$ and common ratio, $r = \frac{0.0012}{0.12} = 0.01$
    \[ \therefore 0.12 = \frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{0.12}{1 - (0.01)} = \frac{0.12}{0.99} = \frac{12}{99} = \frac{4}{33} \]

    \item $1.231 = 1.231231231 \ldots = 1 + (0.231 + 0.000231 + 0.000000231 + \ldots)$
    Here, the series in the parentheses is an infinite geometric series.
    Its first term, $a = 0.231$ and common ratio, $r = \frac{0.000231}{0.231} = 0.001$
    \[ \therefore 1.231 = 1 + \frac{a}{1 - r} = 1 + \frac{0.231}{1 - (0.001)} = 1 + \frac{231}{999} = \frac{1230}{999} = \frac{410}{333} \]
