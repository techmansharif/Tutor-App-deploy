\part{Techniques for Describing Graphs}

\textbf{How to describe graphs and charts?}

Do not copy information from the question paper, use your own words. Make sure that you describe the most important information and that your figures are accurate. Paraphrase the information in the question. Avoid repeating the same words and phrases and try to vary the sentence structures you use. Give an overview of the most important trends or patterns.

When describing trends of graphs and charts, it is best to use:

\begin{itemize}
    \item the simple past to talk about ‘finished’ time, e.g. in 1950, last year.
    \item the present perfect to talk about ‘unfinished’ time, e.g. since 1950, ever, this year
    \item a future tense to talk about future time, e.g. in 2030, next year
\end{itemize}

We often use the following expression when talking about future or predicted data, because the simple future is a little too certain:

\begin{itemize}
    \item … are/is \textbf{predicted} to
    \item … are/is \textbf{expected} to
\end{itemize}

For example: Between 1950 and 2030, the proportion of the world’s population \textbf{is expected to} double.

OR we use a verb such as \textit{predict} and a future tense.

For example: It \textbf{is predicted} that the proportion of the world’s population \textbf{will} double by 2030.

To emphasise a difference, you can use: \textit{many}, \textit{much}, \textit{far}, and \textit{significantly}.

The amount of waste material being recycled in 2011 was \textbf{much} more than in 1985.

For small differences you can use: \textit{slightly} or \textit{nearly as … as}.

The percentage of garbage being recycled in 1970 was \textbf{slightly} higher than in 1960.

\textbf{How to describe bar diagrams:}

When you first see a bar chart, ask yourself the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What do the numbers on the vertical/horizontal axis measure?
    \item How is the information grouped on the other axis?
    \item What do the different shades of the bars show?
    \item When was the data collected?
\end{enumerate}

The answers will give you the essential information for understanding it. Make sure you know which units are being used to measure quantities.

\part{Charts and Interpreting and Comparing Data}

\textbf{Example 1}

The chart below gives information about science qualifications held by people in two countries. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. Write at least 150 words.

\textbf{Science qualification in two countries}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Malaysia \quad Singapore
    \item Master’s degree
    \item Bachelor’s degree
    \item School leaving exams
    \item No qualification in science
    \item 0\% \quad 10\% \quad 20\% \quad 30\% \quad 40\% \quad 50\% \quad 60\% \quad 70\%
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Model answer}

The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people who have a science qualification in Singapore and Malaysia. A prominent feature about both the countries is that a significantly low percentage of people have science qualifications at the Master’s and Bachelor’s level. Less than 5\% of people hold a qualification in science at Master’s degree level in both Singapore and Malaysia.

There is a significant difference in the percentage of people with science qualifications at Bachelor level. While this number is 20\% in Singapore, it is only 10\% in Malaysia. The percentage of people doing science at school leaving exams is slightly higher in Malaysia than in Singapore. 35\% of people in Malaysia have a science qualification at this level, whereas in Singapore it is 30\%. Finally, more than half of the people in both countries have no science qualification at all.

\textbf{Activity 1}

The bar chart below gives information about the percentage of the population living in urban areas in the world and in different continents. Read the following model answer and fill in the gaps to report the main features, and make comparisons.

\textbf{Percentage of population in urban areas}

Source: UN, World Urbanization Prospects: The 2005 Revision (2006) and Carl Haub, 2007 World Population Data Sheet.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
by contrast & in spite of & compares & smaller \\
highest & double & marked & shows \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The bar chart \_\_ the urbanization percentage of the world in 1950 and \_\_ this with the percentage in 2007 and the projected percentage for 2030.

Between 1950 and 2030, the proportion of the world’s population residing in cities is expected to \_\_ growing from 29\% to 60\%. However, this rate is less \_\_ in some continents than others.

For example, 64\% of the population of North America was urban in 1950, increasing to 79\% by 2007. \_\_ just 15\% of the African population was urban in 1950, but this rose to 37\% by 2007. This represents one of the \_\_ urbanization rates in the world, even though the percentage of Africans in urban areas is still \_\_ than the world average.

It is also clear from the graph that, urbanization in Latin America is projected to be higher than Europe in 2030, \_\_ being lower in 1950.

\textbf{Activity 2}

This is a graph on GDP growth in Bangladesh over a period of ten years. The first few sentences are written in the model answer but the description is not complete. Complete the description in your own language.

This graph presents the GDP growth rate of Bangladesh from 2006 to 2015. The data presented in the graph shows that there has been ups and downs in the GDP growth rate. In 2006, it was 5.95, but it rose to the highest ever growth in 2007 which was 6.63, but \_\_

\textbf{Activity 3}

Now describe the following graphs in 150 words.

\textbf{Activity 4}

Describe the following graph in 150 words.

\textbf{Annual per capita income change}

\textbf{Example 2}

The diagrams below give information on transport and car use in Edmonton. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. Write at least 150 words.

\textbf{Tips for comparing information in graphs or charts}

When you describe two figures, ask yourself the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What do both figures relate to?
    \item What kind of relationship is evident? (a similarity, a difference, a cause and effect relationship or some other type of relationship)
    \item Which aspects of each figure should be highlighted?
    \item Should I describe the figures in separate paragraphs, or should I compare different aspects of the figures within a series of paragraphs?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Commute to work & 55\% \\
Shopping & 15\% \\
Leisure activities & 15\% \\
Taking children to school & 40\% \\
Business & 45\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\textbf{People’s reasons for using the car in city}

\textbf{Model answer}

The table shows the reason why people in Edmonton use their cars in the city and the pie chart explains what type of transport people prefer to use most of the time.

Looking at the pie chart first, it is clear that the car is the most popular means of transport in this city. 45\% of the people say that they prefer to commute by car. The second most popular form of transport is the LRT, while buses and taxis are the main means of transport for the rest of the people.

The table gives more detailed information about why people use their cars. Surprisingly, 55\% of the people need to commute to work by car. Cars are also used a lot for taking children to school or business purposes. Only 15\% of drivers are doing their shopping and, similarly, 15\% need to travel by car for leisure.

Overall, people in Edmonton make good use of alternative methods of transport but there is a heavy dependence on cars for work.

\textbf{Note:} There are sometimes two or three pie charts that you must compare. The pie charts may represent different years and show trends over time. You need to describe the changes and similarities/differences between the pie charts.

\textbf{Activity 5}

The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in Japan and Malaysia in the year 2010. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

\textbf{Average Household Expenditures by Major Category}

Japan \quad Malaysia

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
main & But & than & higher \\
smallest & in contrast & compared with & lower \\
higher & overall & indicates & while \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The pie charts show the proportion of money spent on various household expenses in Malaysia and Japan in 2010.

We can see that in Malaysia the greatest proportion of expenditure (34\%) was on housing, \_\_ in Japan housing accounted for just 21\% of the total. \_\_ in Japan the greatest single expense was other goods and services at 29\%, \_\_ 26\% in Malaysia. Food came in second place in Japan, at 24\%, \_\_ in Malaysia the actual proportion was \_\_ (27\%). In Japan another major expense was transport, at 20\%, but this was \_\_ \_\_ in Malaysia (10\%). In both countries the \_\_ percentage of expenditure was on health care. \_\_, the data \_\_ that in both cases food, housing and other goods and services were the \_\_ expenses, \_\_ that in Japan, transport and other goods and services took up a \_\_ proportion of total expenditure \_\_ in Malaysia.

\textbf{Example 3}

The graph below shows the number of books read by men and women at Burnaby Public Library from 2011 to 2014. Describe the graph in your own language.

\textbf{Burnaby Public Library}

\textbf{Model answer}

The graph gives information about the number of books read in Burnaby Public Library between 2011 and 2014.

As can be seen from the graph, there were different trends for men and women. The number of books read by men increased steadily between 2011 and 2012, from about 3000 to 4000. After that, the number rose dramatically to 14000 in 2014. This was the highest figure in the given period.

Women started off reading more books than men, but their numbers followed a different pattern. Between 2011 and 2012, there was an increase from 3000 to 3500 in 2012, and 8000 in 2013. Then there was a gradual rise to 10000 books in 2013. However, in 2014, the numbers fell back to 8000 again.

Overall, there was a strong upward trend in the number of books read by men. Although women read more books than men from 2011 to 2013, their reading fell to below the level of men in 2014.

\textbf{Activity 6}

The line graph below shows the changes in the share price of Outokumpu companies in euros between January 2006 and December 2010. Describe the graph by filling the gaps in the model answer.

\textbf{Outokumpu share price, €}

Source: NASDAQ OMX Helsinki

\textbf{Model answer}

The graph shows the changes in the share price of Outokumpu in a five-year period from \_\_ through \_\_.

At the beginning of this period the share price was at EUR 13 per share. There were several \_\_ until late 2006 when there was a sudden \_\_ from EUR 21 to EUR 31. This higher price did not last long, however, and it \_\_ before rising strongly again in 2008. From mid-2008 there was a \_\_ downward trend through the \_\_ the year. This time it fell to the \_\_ point in this period at just over EUR 7 per share. After that the share price \_\_ and, despite some fluctuations, continued to \_\_ until it reached a peak of EUR 17 in early 2010. Until late 2010 the \_\_ was downward again, ending the year at just over EUR 12.

Outokumpu made significant \_\_ and \_\_ during this period but overall lost around EUR 1 per share.

\textbf{Activity 7}

The chart below shows maternal mortality rate of three different countries. Summarise the chart by comparing information. Write at least 150 words.

\textbf{Maternal mortality ratios}

\textbf{Example 4}

The table below shows the results of a survey that asked 6800 Scottish adults (aged 16 years and over) whether they had taken part in different cultural activities in the past 12 months. Describe the chart by reporting the main features. Make comparisons where relevant.

\textbf{Participation in cultural activities, by age}

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 16-24 & 25-44 & 45-74 & All aged 16 and over \\
& \% & \% & \% & \% \\
\hline
Any performance* & 35 & 22 & 17 & 22 \\
Undertaking any crafts & 11 & 17 & 22 & 19 \\
Cultural purchases & 11 & 17 & 18 & 16 \\
Any visual arts & 30 & 16 & 11 & 15 \\
Any writing & 17 & 6 & 5 & 7 \\
Computer based & 10 & 9 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

* Dancing, singing, playing musical instruments and acting

\textbf{Model answer}

The table shows details of participation in a variety of cultural activities over a year, according to the age of the participants.

Overall, any performance, which includes dancing, singing, playing musical instruments and acting, had the highest level of participation, with 22\% of respondents participating in the previous 12 months. By contrast, computer based activities had the lowest level of participation (6 percent).

People aged between 45 and 74 years old were most likely to undertake any activity to do with crafts (22 percent), while performances were more likely to be participated in by those aged 16 to 24 (35 percent). The differences between age groups were particularly marked in the case of visual arts and writing categories, where participation rates were around three times higher for younger people than for the older ones. It is clear from the evidence that age plays a significant role in the popularity of the cultural activities listed.

\textbf{Activity 8}

The table shows the worldwide market share of the mobile phone market for manufacturers in the years 2005 and 2006. Fill in the gaps in the sample answer to summarise the information and make comparisons where relevant.

\textbf{Worldwide Mobile phone Sales in 2005 \& 2006 (\% share of market)}

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
Company & 2005 \% Market share & 2006 \% Market share \\
\hline
Nokia & 32.5 & 35 \\
Motorola & 17.7 & 21.1 \\
Samsung & 12.7 & 11.8 \\
Sony Ericsson & 6.3 & 7.4 \\
L.G & 6.7 & 6.3 \\
BenQ Mobile & 4.9 & 2.4 \\
Others & 19.2 & 16.2 \\
\hline
TOTAL & 100.0 & 100.0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\textbf{Sample Answer}

The given data shows the market share worldwide for the year 2005 and 2006. As is observed from the given data, Nokia has the highest market share of cell phone worldwide both in 2005 \& 2006.

As is presented, \_\_ had the largest market share (one third of total) in 2005 and their market share increased by \_\_ in the next year. \_\_ had the second largest market share comprising over \_\_ in 2005 and their market share \_\_ as well in the next year by almost 4\%. Samsung had \_\_ been able to maintain the \_\_ for their worldwide mobile phone market share. Their share \_\_ to 11.8\% in 2005 compared to 12.7\% market share in the previous year. On the other hand, Sony Ericsson and L.G both had more than 6\% market share in 2005. In 2006, though Sony Ericsson’s market share \_\_ by 1\%, L.G’s market share \_\_. BenQ Mobile had the \_\_ market share in the cell phone manufacturing worldwide.
