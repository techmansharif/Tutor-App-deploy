\part{First Conditional}

\textbf{A.} Read some examples of first conditional sentences:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{:} Are you coming to my place?\\
    \textbf{:} I’ll go to your place if I finish reading the story book. \textit{(Possible action/situation in the future)}
    \item \textbf{:} I guess I’m going to miss the train.\\
    \textbf{:} If you start now, you won’t miss the train. \textit{(Possibility immediately after the present moment)}
    \item \textbf{:} What will you do, if your first attempts fail?\\
    \textbf{:} If I don’t succeed at my first attempt, I’ll try again. \textit{(First conditional in questions)}
    \item \textbf{:} I think you are going to be late. You haven’t sent the document yet.\\
    \textbf{:} Hmmm....I think if I send it today, Shaymoli might get it tomorrow. \textit{(Use of might: to tell about a possibility)}
    \item Thank you very much for everything.\\
    \textbf{:} No problem. Here is my card. If you need any extra help, just give me a call. \textit{(Imperative in first conditional: to give advice)}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How to make first conditionals?}

First conditionals follow this pattern:

\textit{If + subject + present tense} followed by \textit{subject + future tense (will/may/might + verb) + extension (if needed)}

\textbf{Some conditions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There will be two parts in a first conditional sentence.
    \item First conditional can be used in affirmative, negative, and question sentences.
    \item If the \textit{if} clause comes first, there should be a comma (,) where the \textit{if} clause ends.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Use of $1^{\text{st}}$ conditional}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We use $1^{\text{st}}$ conditional to speak about a future possibility depending on the present situation, the \textit{if}-part is the present condition, and the part with \textit{will/may/might} is the future possibility.
    \item We can use the first conditionals when we talk about possibilities immediately after the present.
    \item We can use \textit{may/might} instead of \textit{will} to say about the result of an action in the first conditional.
    \item We can use imperative in first conditional to give an instruction or advice.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the e-mail written by one friend to another friend. The mail has some use of first conditionals but for each conditional sentence only a part is given. Complete the conditional sentences by selecting and adding the right part from the alternatives given below the mail.

Dear Mithila,\\
Great to hear from you. It is also great to know that you are coming to North Bengal. How many days are you planning to stay here? Are you going on a vacation or coming with any special assignment.\\
Please let me know the date of your coming and tentative stay period. I’ll see you if I \textit{(a)} \_\_. I’ll also \textit{(b)} \_\_ if I can manage my parents. Who else are coming with you?\\
I often think of our lost days. They were really so sweet! \textit{(c)} \_\_ if you can. I will copy them from you. And don’t forget your camera please for new photographs.\\
However, we have a possibility to go on a study tour in March. Hope that will not coincide with your stay here. Yet, if it happens, \textit{(d)} \_\_?\\
Stay fine. And keep in touch.\\
