\part{Positive Adjectives}

\textbf{A.} Read the letter and follow the words in bold:

Dear John,\\
Writing from my home. I'm in Bangladesh, finally. It's late December. The weather is \textbf{fantastic}! It's not at all \textbf{humid}. The temperature is \textbf{moderate} -- in between 26--28 degree. Unlike England there is no rain, no \textbf{strong} wind here. Usually we have \textbf{strong} sun but now the sunlight is very \textbf{soothing}. In fact, our winter begins from November and continues till February. January is the \textbf{coldest} month in Bangladesh. The most \textbf{interesting} feature of winter Bangladesh is -- the country is full of \textbf{interesting} vegetables and \textbf{delicious} pitha, a kind of handmade cakes. Many foreigners like Bangladeshi winter as it is \textbf{milder} than the winter in many parts of the world such as England, Canada, or Russia.

You know, my father produces winter vegetables every year. I'm very fond of bottle gourds. This time the gourds are \textbf{bigger} and \textbf{nicer} than the previous years. Hope they will taste \textbf{more interesting} too. Well, I got to go now. Write to me soon.

Love,\\
Rima

\textbf{What are the words in bold doing?}

All these words in bold are adjectives. Some of them come before a noun and modify it, e.g., give extra information about it. Some of the words are completing the sentences. Thus adjectives work either as noun modifiers or as complements (that completes) of a sentence.

\textbf{Adjectives have three forms:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Positive} use of adjectives without comparing: e.g., The temperature is moderate.
    \item \textbf{Comparative} use of adjectives to compare two things or persons: e.g., This time the gourds are bigger and nicer than the previous years.
    \item \textbf{Superlative} use of adjectives to show the best or worst (comparison between many): e.g., January is the coldest month in Bangladesh.
\end{itemize}

\part{Comparative Adjectives}

\textbf{Grammar Rules for Comparative Adjectives}

We form comparative adjectives in this way:

1. \textbf{Short adjectives with one syllable}
\begin{itemize}
    \item By adding -er: mild $\rightarrow$ milder
\end{itemize}

2. \textbf{Short adjectives ending with one vowel and one consonant}
\begin{itemize}
    \item By doubling the consonant and adding -er: big $\rightarrow$ bigger
\end{itemize}

3. \textbf{Short adjectives ending with -e}
\begin{itemize}
    \item By adding -r: nice $\rightarrow$ nicer
\end{itemize}

4. \textbf{Long adjectives with two or more syllables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item By adding more with the adjectives: interesting $\rightarrow$ more interesting
\end{itemize}

5. \textbf{Adjectives ending with -y}
\begin{itemize}
    \item By changing y to -ier: dirty $\rightarrow$ dirtier
\end{itemize}

6. \textbf{Irregular adjectives} that do not follow any rule. We need to remember their other forms, such as:
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lll}
good & better & best \\
bad & worse & worst \\
far & farther & farthest \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Use}

We use comparative adjectives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To tell about the differences between two or more things
    \item To give facts and opinions
    \item To compare and contrast
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the following dialogue and indicate which of the above rules the adjective is following in each sentence. The first one is done for you.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{A:} How was the food?
    \item \textbf{B:} That was the \textbf{costliest} food I had ever had. \textbf{Rule 5}
    \item \textbf{A:} But believe me, the food was really \textbf{delicious}.
    \item \textbf{B:} How was the service?
    \item \textbf{A:} It was also very \textbf{good}. The service was \textbf{quicker} than the one we had last week. Perhaps this is why the price of the foods is \textbf{much higher} than the neighbouring restaurants. \textbf{Rule \_\_}
    \item \textbf{B:} Once I went to that restaurant. I liked the restaurant but the curry was \textbf{thicker} than what I like. \textbf{Rule \_\_}
    \item \textbf{A:} Really! I think it was \textbf{lighter} than that in your uncle's restaurant. \textbf{Rule \_\_}
    \item \textbf{B:} Anyway, and how about the ice cream?
    \item \textbf{A:} \textbf{Nicer} than what we are eating now. \textbf{Rule \_\_}
    \item \textbf{B:} But don't you think the glasses are \textbf{bigger} here? \textbf{Rule \_\_}
    \item \textbf{A:} I don't know. In fact to me the \textbf{most important} thing is the taste not the quantity. \textbf{Rule \_\_}
