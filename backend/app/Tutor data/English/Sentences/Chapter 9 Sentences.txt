\section*{09 Sentences}
\part{Clauses}
\subsection*{9/1: Clauses}

A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate. There are two kinds of clauses: independent and subordinate clauses. A clause may be either a sentence (an independent clause) or a sentence-like construction within another sentence (a dependent or subordinate clause).

\subsubsection*{A. The Independent Clause}

An independent clause expresses a complete thought and can stand by itself as a sentence. If you recognize a sentence, you should be able to recognize independent clauses.

Look at the following examples:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Many people are afraid of tornadoes.
    \item A tornado can be terrifying.
    \item A tornado is a violently revolving storm.
    \item In the centre of the tornado is an area of calm air.
    \item The centre of the tornado is known as the “eye”.
    \item This eye is formed by the air spiraling around it.
    \item This eye is simply a hollow space.
\end{itemize}

All the above sentences are independent clauses. A sentence may have more than one independent clause.

For example,

\begin{itemize}
    \item A tornado is a violently revolving storm and it can be terrifying.
    \item The centre of the tornado is known as the “eye”, but it is simply a hollow space.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 1}

Write down ten independent clauses about yourself.

\subsubsection*{B. The Subordinate Clause}

A subordinate clause is a group of words that has a subject and a predicate but cannot stand by itself as complete sentence because it does not express a complete thought. While an independent clause can stand alone as a complete thought, a subordinate clause cannot stand alone. Subordinate clauses are sometimes called dependent clauses.

Look at the following examples. Each sentence has two parts, and in each part there is a subject and a predicate. However, the second part in the first sentence and the first part in the second sentence cannot stand alone, and therefore, they are subordinate clauses.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The crowds cheered to greet Mashrafi \underline{when he entered the stadium}.
    \item \underline{As he walked across the field}, he waved back to the audience.
\end{itemize}

Study the following sentences, which contain subordinate clauses. Notice that the subordinate clauses are introduced by words like \textit{since}, \textit{when}, \textit{if}, \textit{as}, \textit{who}, \textit{which}, and \textit{that}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Luna, \underline{who was the Roman goddess of the moon}, gave us the word lunatic.
    \item \underline{Since at one time the moon was believed to cause madness}, people avoided moonlight.
    \item Anyone \underline{that slept with the moon shining in his/her face} might become mad.
    \item Even today many people feel uncomfortable \underline{if the moon shines in on them while they are sleeping}.
\end{itemize}

(The examples above have been taken from Warriner’s English Grammar and Composition, 1973)

A sentence may have more than one subordinate clause. For example, see the last sentence above.

\textbf{B.1 Kinds of subordinate clauses:}

A subordinate clause may function as an adjective, an adverb, or a noun.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*)]
    \item \textbf{Clauses used as adjectives}: A subordinate clause functions as an adjective if it modifies a noun or a pronoun. Such clauses are sometimes called \textit{adjective clauses}.

    Look at the following sentences. The subjects of the subordinate clauses are underlined, and the predicates are shown in bold type.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The movie \underline{that} you \textbf{recommended} to me was good. (Which movie? The one that you recommended to me.)
        \item A doctor \underline{who} \textbf{takes care} of children is a pediatrician. (Which kind of doctor? A doctor who takes care of children.)
    \end{itemize}

    In the above sentences, the subordinate clauses, \textit{that you recommended to me}, and \textit{who takes care of children}, are adjective clauses.

    Most adjective clauses begin with a relative pronoun: \textit{that}, \textit{which}, \textit{who}, \textit{whom}, \textit{whose}.

    You may also introduce adjective clauses with relative adverbs: \textit{after}, \textit{before}, \textit{since}, \textit{where}, \textit{why}.

    For example: It was a place \underline{where crowds gathered in the evenings}. (Subordinate clause)

    \item \textbf{Adverb Clauses}: A subordinate clause functions as an adverb if it modifies a verb, an adjective, or an adverb. Such clauses are sometimes called \textit{adverb clauses}.

    Here are some examples of adverb clauses:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \underline{Before you buy a television}, you should compare prices. (modifies verb)
        \item Aleya was proud \underline{that the theatre group chose her}. (modifies adjective)
    \end{itemize}

    Like adverbs, adverb clauses tell \textit{how}, \textit{when}, \textit{where}, and \textit{to what extent}. They may also explain \textit{why}.

    Look at the following sentences:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{How}: The building swayed \underline{as though it would collapse}.
        \item \textbf{When}: \underline{Before the storm started}, Nayan took shelter in a building.
        \item \textbf{Where}: We can have lunch \underline{wherever you want}.
        \item \textbf{To What Extent}: Maya studied the poem \underline{until she had memorized it}.
        \item \textbf{Why}: Shahed came early \underline{so that he would get a good seat}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Noun Clauses}: Some subordinate clauses function as nouns in sentences. Such clauses are called \textit{noun clauses}. A noun clause may function as a subject, a predicate nominative, a direct object, an indirect object, an object of a preposition, or an appositive.

    Examples:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Subject}: \underline{That he is generous} is evident.
        \item \textbf{Predicate Nominative}: That is \underline{what we decided}.
        \item \textbf{Direct Object}: I don’t know \underline{where Seema is}.
        \item \textbf{Indirect Object}: Give \underline{whoever is coming} a message.
        \item \textbf{Object of a Preposition}: I was criticized for \underline{what I did}.
        \item \textbf{Appositive}: The subject of my speech, \underline{that taxes should be lowered}, was well received.
    \end{itemize}

    You may introduce a noun clause with either an interrogative pronoun (such as, \textit{who}, \textit{whom}, \textit{whose}, \textit{which}, \textit{whatever}, \textit{whoever}, \textit{whomever}, etc.) or, a subordinating conjunction (such as, \textit{how}, \textit{that}, \textit{when}, \textit{where}, \textit{whether}, \textit{why}, etc.)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Activity 2}

Identify the subordinate clauses in the following sentences.

\begin{itemize}
    \item I couldn’t remember \underline{when you were going to present your paper on “Education and Development”}.
    \item \underline{After you finish this work}, let’s discuss the plans for your next project.
    \item \underline{If you agree}, we can work as a team.
    \item \underline{While I talked}, I noticed \underline{that she was not actually listening to me}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 3}

Add an independent clause to (either at the beginning or after) each of the following subordinate clauses, and write the whole sentence on your paper.

\begin{itemize}
    \item i) \underline{when I woke up this morning}
    \item ii) \underline{if it rains tomorrow}
    \item iii) \underline{but I have to finish my homework}
    \item iv) \underline{although we met before}
    \item v) \underline{which you promised to do}
\end{itemize}

\part{Meaning and Types}
\subsection*{9/2: Meaning and Types}

\textbf{A.} Read the following examples.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Bill Gates is the founder of Microsoft.
    \item He is the pioneer of modern Information Technology.
    \item He is doing a lot of works for the service of humanity.
\end{enumerate}

Now read these examples:

\begin{enumerate}[start=4]
    \item wonder is the of modern science mobile phone.
    \item contact with people can others mobile phone within a second through.
    \item reduced it has labour our time and.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Thinking questions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Do the first three examples express meaning?
    \item What about the next three examples?
    \item Do they express meaning? If not, rearrange the words in each example to make it meaningful.
\end{itemize}

A sentence is a group of words at least with a subject and a verb expressing a complete sense.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Work with a partner. Identify which ones are sentences and which are not.

\begin{itemize}
    \item (a) Farida, a primary school teacher, works in the district of Lalmonirhat.
    \item (b) As a social worker she started.
    \item (c) Under her close monitoring she has managed.
    \item (d) She has managed to stop many early marriages of girls’ students.
    \item (e) Many girls have realised the need for education and they are attending schools.
    \item (f) Like Farida many other women are coming forward too.
    \item (g) Localauthority is also very helpful and providing support to Farida’s effort.
    \item (h) She has been able to draw the attention of many parents.
    \item (i) Her efforts have also drawn the attention.
    \item (j) Different medias and international organizations are highlighting about Farida’s.
    \item (k) Currently she has been selected for an international award.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Types of Sentences: according to meaning}

\textbf{B.} Now read and study the following sentences.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Cricket has got much popularity in our country.
    \item Still many people are not interested to watch this game.
    \item Do you like to watch this game?
    \item Let’s watch a cricket match this evening.
    \item Talk to your mother for permission to go to the stadium.
    \item Call Asif to accompany us.
    \item Oh, What an interesting idea it is!
    \item How enjoyable and thrilling the match will be!
    \item May our cricket team win the ‘World Cup’!
\end{enumerate}

What do the sentences 1 \& 2 express and what is the difference between them?

The $1^{\text{st}}$ one is an \textit{affirmative sentence} and the $2^{\text{nd}}$ one is a \textit{negative sentence}. They express statement. So a sentence which expresses/makes a statement or assertion is called an \textit{Assertive sentence}.

Now notice the 3rd sentence and try to fill in the following gap with the right word. The $3^{\text{rd}}$ sentence expresses \textit{a question} and it is an \textit{Interrogative sentence}. So a sentence which expresses/asks a \textit{question} is an \textit{Interrogative sentence}.

Now notice the sentences 4, 5, and 6. The sentences express \textit{proposal}, \textit{advice}, and \textit{direction/instruction} respectively, and these are \textit{Imperative sentences}. So a sentence which expresses \textit{a command, request, or suggestion} is called an \textit{Imperative sentence}.

Notice sentences no. 7 and no. 8. They express \textit{sudden emotion} and they are \textit{Exclamatory sentences}. So a sentence which expresses \textit{sudden emotion or surprise} is an \textit{Exclamatory sentence}.

Now notice sentence no. 9. The sentence no. 9 expresses \textit{a wish or prayer} and it is an \textit{Optative sentence}. So a sentence which expresses \textit{a wish or prayer} is an \textit{Optative sentence}.

\textbf{Activity 2}

Identify the different kinds of sentences from the given text. Work in groups.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Patriotism is a noble virtue. \textit{(Assertive, affirmative)}
    \item Have you heard the name of Birsreshtha Mostofa Kamal? \textit{(Interrogative)}
    \item Read his biography. \textit{(Imperative)}
    \item See how brave he was! \textit{(Exclamatory)}
    \item He laid down his life for the sake of his country. \textit{(Assertive, affirmative)}
    \item Do you know his birthplace? \textit{(Interrogative)}
    \item Every year on $16^{\text{th}}$ December the nation pays special homage to the heroes like him. \textit{(Assertive, affirmative)}
    \item Different organizations organize different programmes highlighting the day. \textit{(Assertive, affirmative)}
    \item May the Almighty bless our national heroes! \textit{(Optative)}
    \item Have you ever participated in any programme on this day? \textit{(Interrogative)}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Activity 3}

Match the items in column A with those in column B to make sentences.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Column A} & \textbf{Column B} \\
1. News paper plays & a. have the habit of reading newspaper every day. \\
2. It publishes & b. enrich his general knowledge and makes him aware of current issues. \\

\end{tabular}

\part{Structures and Types}

\subsection*{9/3: Sentences: Structures and Types}

In the previous lesson you have learned that sentences may be classified according to their purpose or meaning: assertive (positive/negative), interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory. Another way to classify sentences is according to their construction, the kind and number of their clauses.

\subsubsection*{A. The Simple Sentence}

A simple sentence has one independent clause and no subordinate clauses.

Look at the examples of simple sentences below. Notice that a simple sentence may have a compound subject (sentence 2) or a compound predicate (sentence 3) or both (sentence 4). A compound subject consists of two or more connected subjects that have the same verb. A compound predicate consists of two or more connected verbs that have the same subject.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Bangladesh has some beautiful tourist spots.
    \item The tea gardens in Sylhet and the forests of the Sundarbans are favourite tourist attractions. (The two parts of the compound subject have the same verb, \textit{are}.)
    \item We planned to go to Sylhet but then went to the Sundarbans instead.
    \item Paban and Sara brought some bananas and fed the monkeys.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Activity 1}

Identify the compound subjects or the compound predicates in the following simple sentences.

\begin{itemize}
    \item i) The manager and his secretary went out to lunch. \textit{(compound subject: The manager and his secretary)}
    \item ii) The manager finished his ice-cream and ordered for a coffee. \textit{(compound predicate: finished his ice-cream and ordered for a coffee)}
    \item iii) Hasan, Karim and Shahana will go on the field trip with us. \textit{(compound subject: Hasan, Karim and Shahana)}
    \item iv) Jogging, swimming, and cycling are good exercises. \textit{(compound subject: Jogging, swimming, and cycling)}
    \item v) Jogging strengthens the heart and lungs but is hard on the knees and ankles. \textit{(compound predicate: strengthens the heart and lungs but is hard on the knees and ankles)}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 2}

Make sentences by adding compound subjects to these predicates.

\begin{itemize}
    \item i) are competing in the race.
    \item ii) make good pets.
    \item iii) went to Bhutan on holidays last week.
    \item iv) On Shihab’s study table were piled.
    \item v) amused the audience at the circus thoroughly.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 3}

Make sentences by adding compound predicates to the following subjects.

\begin{itemize}
    \item i) At the Trade Fair we
    \item ii) The doctor
    \item iii) The singer
    \item iv) Last week some of my friends
    \item v) Jack and Jill
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{B. The Compound Sentence}

A compound sentence has two or more independent clauses but no subordinate clauses. The independent clauses are usually joined by some connecting or linking words such as, \textit{and}, \textit{but}, \textit{or}, \textit{nor}, \textit{for}, \textit{yet}, \textit{however}, \textit{therefore}, etc. We can also join the independent clauses by using a semicolon.

Following are some examples of compound sentences:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I like jogging, but I like swimming better.
    \item Razzak graduated last year, and now he works in a private bank.
    \item I wanted to go to the concert, but I didn’t get the ticket.
    \item The giraffe has a long neck and long legs, but it is a very graceful animal.
    \item Fruits and vegetables should be a part of everyone’s diet, for they supply necessary vitamins.
    \item It was a good day for outing; I went cycling in the countryside.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{C. The Complex Sentence}

A complex sentence consists of one independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses.

\begin{itemize}
    \item We had lunch at the student cafeteria \underline{when we visited the college}.
    \item He gave her a pair of bangles \underline{which belonged to his mother}.
    \item \underline{While we walked along the beach}, it started raining.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the following sentences and identify them as simple, compound, or complex sentences. Explain how you made the classification:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The blue Toyota car in the parking lot is mine. \textit{(Simple: one independent clause, no subordinate clauses)}
    \item \underline{Although I’ll miss driving the car}, I’ll sell it \underline{if I can get a good price}. \textit{(Complex: one independent clause, two subordinate clauses)}
    \item The blue Toyota car in the parking lot is mine; however, I might sell it. \textit{(Compound: two independent clauses joined by a semicolon and \textit{however})}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 2}

Identify the principal clauses and subordinate clauses from the text below and locate the connectors. The first one is done for you.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a. Illiteracy is a curse \underline{which is the root cause of ignorance}.\\
    \textit{Main clause}: Illiteracy is a curse\\
    \textit{Subordinate clause}: which is the root cause of ignorance\\
    \textit{Connector}: which
    \item b. \underline{If a man is illiterate}, he gets little opportunity to contribute to the society.
    \item c. Abdul was an illiterate man, but he was very eager to learn about things.
    \item d. One of his friends asked him \underline{why he was not attending a night school}.
    \item e. Then he got himself admitted into a night school and started studying there.
    \item f. \underline{Although it was difficult for him}, he continued going to school.
    \item g. He was poor but he was ambitious.
    \item h. \underline{Since he worked hard during day time}, he studied at night.
    \item i. His teachers helped him much \underline{when he found any difficulties}.
    \item j. He did not sleep at night \underline{until he could complete his home work}.
    \item k. He did a lot of voluntary works for the society \underline{even though he was busy}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{9/4: Wh-Questions}

\textbf{A.} Read the text and answer the questions that follow.

Rahmat, a farmer lives in the village of Tanoir. He cultivates the lands of others. He leads a very ordinary life. He always shares his joys and sufferings with his neighbours.

From the above text we can make Wh-Questions like this:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Who is Rahmat?
    \item Where does he live?
    \item Whose land does he cultivate?
    \item How does he lead his life?
    \item Who does he share his joys and sufferings with?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Activity 1}

Fill in the gaps to understand what wh-question is.

A Wh-question is a question which begins with \_\_. The answers to Wh-questions cannot be given by just \_\_ or \_\_. Answers should usually be in a sentence.

Notice how wh-questions are made:

\textbf{What}:

Rafiq’s word made me laugh. His behaviour made me unhappy. I was thinking of sharing my feelings with my friend, Aysha.

Wh questions - What made you laugh? What made you unhappy? What were you thinking of?

\textbf{Who}:

Nipa is doing good in English. But her sister Sima is still quite weak in English. Abir is teaching English to both of them.

Wh questions - Who is doing good in English? Who is still weak in English? Who is teaching the sisters English?

\textbf{Whose}:

My book was stolen. I took Liza’s book. Aleya’s book was missing too.

Wh question - Whose book did you take? Whose book was stolen? Whose book was missing?

\textbf{Which}:

It was a football match between the students of class 9 and 10. The students of class 9 won the match.

Wh question - Students of which classes were playing the match? Which class won the match?

\textbf{Where}:

We’re going to Rajendrapur tomorrow. We’ll stay in the Green Resort there. From there we’ll go to Tangail the next day.

Wh question - Where are you going tomorrow? Where will you stay? Where will you go from there?

\textbf{When}:

The show will start at 7 pm. I am going there at 6.30 pm. My friend will meet me there at 6.40 pm.

Wh question - When will the show start? When are you going there? When will your friend meet you?

\textbf{Why}:

I didn’t go to school yesterday as I was not feeling well. I called my friend to know the home work.

Wh question - Why didn’t you go to school yesterday? Why did you call your friend?

\textbf{How}:

We’ll go to Chattogram by train tomorrow. We’ll stay there for two days.

Wh question - How will you go to Chattogram? How long will you stay there?

\textit{Note}: \textit{How} is often used to express \textit{how far}, \textit{how much}, \textit{how many}, \textit{how long}, \textit{how slow}, \textit{how fast}, etc. e.g. How far is Chattogram from Cumilla? How long does it take to go there by bus/train?

\textbf{Activity 2}

Now make Wh Questions from the given text (\textit{who}, \textit{which}, \textit{what}, \textit{when}, \textit{how}, \textit{which}, \textit{why}).

\begin{itemize}
    \item a. The liberation war took place in 1971.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a. \underline{Bangladesh} is famous for its garments industry.
    \item b. The readymade garments of Bangladesh are very popular in \underline{Europe and America}.
    \item c. About \underline{80\% workers} are female in the garments industry.

\part{Tag Questions}

\subsection*{9/5: Tag Questions}

\textbf{A.} Read the following conversation:

\textbf{Sam:} It’s a nice party, isn’t it?\\
\textbf{Zinia:} Yes, it is indeed. We’re going to stay the whole night, aren’t we?\\
\textbf{Sam:} I think so. By the way, I haven’t seen you for a long time.\\
\textbf{Zinia:} I was in the USA for six weeks.\\
\textbf{Sam:} Oh, really? You didn’t go there on business, did you?\\
\textbf{Zinia:} No, I didn’t. Actually I went there to attend my brother’s graduation ceremony.\\
\textbf{Sam:} You are not going away anywhere soon, are you?\\
\textbf{Zinia:} No, I’m not. You missed me, didn’t you?

If we study the above sentences, we notice that each of the sentence ends with a question. These questions are different from the wh-questions or ‘yes/no’ questions. These are called \textit{tag questions}.

We also notice that, if the statement is affirmative, the tag question is negative. If the statement is negative, the tag question is affirmative.

So, a tag question is a kind of question asked by the speaker after a negative or an affirmative statement during conversation. They are normally used in speech when we want to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item confirm that something is true or not, or
    \item to encourage a reply from the person we are speaking to.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{1. Intonation and meaning:}

When a tag question is spoken, the voice can go up or down.

It is a nice party, isn’t it?

A falling intonation means the speaker is sure (or almost sure) that the statement is true. He/she only wants to confirm. The tag is not really a question.

A rising intonation means that even though the speaker expects to hear ‘yes’, the speaker is less sure and wants to know.

You didn’t go there on business, did you?

\textbf{B.} Why do we use tag questions?

We can use tag questions to verify or check information that we think is true, or to check information that we aren’t sure about.

The interesting things about tag questions are that they have varied uses. The tag question is in fact a typical feature of conversation in English.

\textbf{Different uses of ‘tag questions’:}

\textbf{C.} Read the following tag questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item You have known Shumona for a long time, haven’t you?
    \item Shumona is Bangladeshi, isn’t she?
    \item She lives in Dhaka, doesn’t she?
    \item She has lived here all her life, hasn’t she?
    \item She went to Delhi for higher studies last year, didn’t she?
    \item She speaks good English, doesn’t she?
    \item She can help you, can’t she?
    \item But she wouldn’t, would she?
\end{itemize}

\textit{Note}: If the verb used in the statement is an auxiliary verb, then the auxiliary verb is repeated in the tag question. If a modal (\textit{can}, \textit{could}, \textit{will}, \textit{should}, etc.) is used in the statement, then the same modal is used in the tag part. If the statement doesn’t use an auxiliary verb, then the auxiliary \textit{do/does/did} is used in the tag question.

\textbf{D.} Read the following tag questions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item He hardly watches movie, does he?
    \item He never came back, did he?
\end{itemize}

\textit{Note}: If there are words such as \textit{seldom}, \textit{hardly}, \textit{barely}, \textit{scarcely}, \textit{nothing}, \textit{none}, \textit{no one}, \textit{neither}, \textit{few}, \textit{little}, \textit{never} in a sentence, it is considered as a negative sentence. Therefore, notice that tag questions are in affirmation.

\textbf{E.} Read the following examples.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Nobody likes to be criticized, do they?
    \item Everybody wanted to talk to the celebrity, didn’t they?
\end{itemize}

\textit{Note}: If \textit{everybody}, \textit{all}, \textit{somebody}, \textit{someone}, \textit{anybody}, \textit{any one}, \textit{no one}, \textit{none} is used as a subject, then the subject of the tag question would be ‘they’.

\textbf{F.} Read the following examples.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Nothing was easy, was it?
    \item Anything will be all right, will it?
\end{itemize}

\textit{Note}: If \textit{anything}, \textit{something}, \textit{everything}, \textit{nothing} is used as a subject, then ‘it’ would be used as a pronoun.

Read the examples below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Take a seat, won’t you?
    \item Help me, will you?
    \item Close the door, would you?
    \item Let us go out for a walk, shall we?

\end{itemize}

Notice that we could answer all the questions in the above conversation with just yes/no. But in many contexts it wouldn’t sound very polite. Hence, a short answer (Yes, I did. No, I didn’t, and so on) is more usual.

Usually we don’t use a full sentence to answer a wh-question, but to add emphasis and, for variation we can sometimes use a full sentence.

\textbf{Short Answers for requests, suggestions, offers, and invitations.}
