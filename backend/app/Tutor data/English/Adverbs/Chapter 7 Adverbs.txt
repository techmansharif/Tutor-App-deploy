\part{Adverbs and Their Functions}

\textbf{A.} Read the following sentences. Identify the adverbs in them and say which words they modify.

\begin{itemize}
    \item He is going \textbf{abroad} soon. (\textit{abroad} modifies \textit{is going}, \textit{soon} modifies \textit{is going})
    \item I have done \textbf{very badly} in the exam. (\textit{very badly} modifies \textit{have done})
    \item They live \textbf{upstairs}. (\textit{upstairs} modifies \textit{live})
    \item The girl is \textbf{fairly} tall. (\textit{fairly} modifies \textit{tall})
    \item She \textbf{seldom} visits me here. (\textit{seldom} modifies \textit{visits})
    \item He was \textbf{almost} dead then. (\textit{almost} modifies \textit{dead})
    \item They \textbf{rarely} talk with each other. (\textit{rarely} modifies \textit{talk})
    \item \textbf{Unfortunately}, he failed the test. (\textit{unfortunately} modifies \textit{failed})
    \item He lost \textbf{almost} everything. (\textit{almost} modifies \textit{everything})
    \item He came here \textbf{simply} because he wanted to meet me. (\textit{simply} modifies \textit{came})
    \item It is \textbf{absolutely} beyond my capacity to help you. (\textit{absolutely} modifies \textit{beyond})
\end{itemize}

\part{Kinds of Adverbs}

\textbf{A.} Read the following passage and notice the adverbs:

Salam is \textbf{trying hard} to go \textbf{abroad} for higher studies. He saw me \textbf{today} to discuss the matter with me. He \textbf{often} seeks my advice.

There are four adverbs in this passage and they are of four different kinds.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The adverb `\textbf{hard}' answers the question “how?”. It is called an \textit{adverb of manner}.
    \item “\textbf{Abroad}” answers the question “where?”. It is called an \textit{adverb of place}.
    \item “\textbf{Today}” answers the question “when?”. It is called an \textit{adverb of time}.
    \item “\textbf{Often}” expresses the frequency of an action. It is called an \textit{adverb of frequency}.
\end{itemize}

These are the four main types of adverbs.

Now, identify the four kinds of adverbs in the following passage.

Khan is a busy man. He \textbf{seldom} calls me. But \textbf{yesterday} he requested me to go \textbf{downtown} with him. I could not say no to him. He invited me \textbf{very cordially}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{seldom}: adverb of frequency
    \item \textbf{yesterday}: adverb of time
    \item \textbf{downtown}: adverb of place
    \item \textbf{very cordially}: adverb of manner
\end{itemize}

\textbf{B.} There are also some other kinds of adverbs. Read the following sentences and notice the adverbs in them.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textbf{Adverbs of degree (Intensifiers)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The boy is \textbf{very} smart. (\textit{very} intensifies \textit{smart})
        \item He is \textbf{too} weak to walk. (\textit{too} intensifies \textit{weak})
        \item The girl is \textbf{fairly} tall. (\textit{fairly} intensifies \textit{tall})
        \item He looked at me \textbf{quite indifferently}. (\textit{quite} intensifies \textit{indifferently})
        \item His statement was \textbf{absolutely} true. (\textit{absolutely} intensifies \textit{true})
    \end{itemize}
    Think of two/three other adverbs of degree and make sentences with them.
    \item \textbf{Interrogative adverbs}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Where} are you going? (\textit{where} questions place)
        \item \textbf{When} do you sleep at night? (\textit{when} questions time)
        \item \textbf{How} did you do the work? (\textit{how} questions manner)
        \item \textbf{Why} are you laughing? (\textit{why} questions cause)
    \end{itemize}
    These are called interrogative adverbs. These adverbs are used for asking questions about the place, time, manner, and cause of an action. Notice where they are used.
    \item \textbf{Adverbs of affirmation and negation}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You will \textbf{surely/certainly} pass the exam. (\textit{surely/certainly} affirm)
        \item I \textbf{did not} go there. (\textit{not} negates)
        \item `Do you like cricket?' `\textbf{Yes}, I do.' (\textit{yes} affirms)
        \item `Will you come here?' `\textbf{No}, I won’t.' (\textit{no} negates)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{C.} Adverbs may take different positions in a sentence. Look at the following examples:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The boy is reading \textbf{loudly}. (\textit{loudly}, manner, after verb)
    \item They were boating \textbf{downstream}. (\textit{downstream}, place, after verb)
    \item I am \textbf{very} busy \textbf{now}. (\textit{very}, degree, before adjective; \textit{now}, time, after verb)
\end{itemize}

The adverbs of manner, place, and time are usually used after the verbs they modify. Use some other such adverbs in this position.

But an adverb of frequency is usually used between the subject and the verb. For example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item He \textbf{always} speaks the truth.
    \item It \textbf{hardly} rains here.
    \item They \textbf{rarely} eat together.
    \item He \textbf{usually} comes here in the afternoon.
\end{itemize}

Adverbs of degree are used before an adjective or adverb. For example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item He is \textbf{totally} mad.
    \item It is raining \textbf{very} hard.
\end{itemize}

Interrogative adverbs are always used at the beginning of a sentence. For example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Where} was he born?
    \item \textbf{Why} are you so callous?
\end{itemize}

Adverbs actually do not have any fixed position in a sentence. They can change their position to serve different functions.

\part{Adverbials}

\textbf{A.} Read the following questions and think of their answers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item When will you see me?
    \item Where are you going now?
    \item How is it raining?
    \item How frequently does he visit you?
    \item Why are you waiting here?
\end{itemize}

Each of the first four questions can be answered by using a single word. For example, you can say:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I shall see you \textbf{tomorrow}.
    \item I am going \textbf{downstairs}.
    \item It is raining \textbf{hard/heavily}.
    \item He \textbf{scarcely} visits me.
\end{itemize}

These single words are adverbs. You have seen their use in the preceding lessons. But you can answer any of the above questions by using a group of words. For example, you can say:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I shall see you \textbf{in the afternoon}.
    \item I am going \textbf{to school}.
    \item It is raining \textbf{very hard}.
    \item He visits me \textbf{thrice a week}.
    \item I am waiting here \textbf{to receive my friend}.
\end{itemize}

These are all \textit{adverbial phrases}. An adverbial phrase is a group of words that modifies a verb in the sentence.

Identify the adverbial phrases in the following conversation:

\textbf{Mukta:} When are you going to Dhaka?\\
\textbf{Mukul:} I’m going there \textbf{next week}.\\
\textbf{Mukta:} Why are you going?\\
\textbf{Mukul:} I’m going there \textbf{to attend a seminar}.\\
\textbf{Mukta:} How are you going?\\
\textbf{Mukul:} I’m going \textbf{by bus}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{next week}: adverbial phrase of time
    \item \textbf{to attend a seminar}: adverbial phrase of purpose
    \item \textbf{by bus}: adverbial phrase of manner
\end{itemize}

\textbf{B.} Adverbs and adverbial phrases have a common name. This name is \textit{Adverbial}. That means, an adverbial is a single word or a group of words which modifies a verb. Look at the underlined words/phrases in the following sentences:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textbf{Adverbials of time}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rashid saw me \underline{\textbf{yesterday}}.
        \item I asked him to come \underline{\textbf{in the morning}}.
        \item It was raining \underline{\textbf{then}}.
        \item I shall go to Dhaka \underline{\textbf{next week}}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adverbials of place}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can you come \underline{\textbf{here}}?
        \item I went \underline{\textbf{there}} \underline{\textbf{to invite my friend}}.
        \item He was born \underline{\textbf{in a big city}}.
        \item I am living \underline{\textbf{in an apartment}}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adverbials of manner}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He speaks \underline{\textbf{loudly}}.
        \item She was \underline{\textbf{brutally}} killed.
        \item The problem was solved \underline{\textbf{in an amicable way}}.
        \item He was wounded \underline{\textbf{very seriously}}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adverbials of frequency}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It \underline{\textbf{often}} rains here.
        \item He \underline{\textbf{never}} tells a lie.
        \item She phones me \underline{\textbf{four times a day}}.
        \item I go to Dhaka \underline{\textbf{almost every week}}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adverbials of purpose}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I went home \underline{\textbf{to take rest}}.
        \item He is going abroad \underline{\textbf{for higher studies}}.
        \item She studies hard \underline{\textbf{to pass the exam}}.
        \item They jumped into the pond \underline{\textbf{to save the child}}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adverbial clauses}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An adverbial may also be a dependent clause in a complex sentence. For example:
        \item I shall go home \underline{\textbf{after he comes}}.
        \item The girl had been married off \underline{\textbf{before she was 18}}.
        \item You can sit \underline{\textbf{wherever you like}}.
        \item It is raining \underline{\textbf{like the sky is falling}}.
        \item The flight was delayed \underline{\textbf{because the weather was foggy}}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textit{Note:} Anything—be it a word, phrase, or clause—that modifies a verb is an \textit{adverbial}. All adverbs are adverbials but all adverbials are not adverbs.

\textbf{C.} Read the following passage and identify the different kinds of adverbials in it:

One day I was sitting \underline{\textbf{alone}} upon a bench at a park near my house. \underline{\textbf{Suddenly}}, a young girl arrived \underline{\textbf{there}}. She was \underline{\textbf{beautifully}} dressed. She sat beside me and began to talk with me \underline{\textbf{very cordially}}. We talked \underline{\textbf{for about half an hour}} and then we began to walk \underline{\textbf{together}}. \underline{\textbf{Within a short time}} we became good friends. When we parted, we promised \underline{\textbf{never}} to forget each other. We now phone each other \underline{\textbf{every day}}. We visit each other \underline{\textbf{almost regularly}}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{alone}: adverbial of manner
    \item \textbf{suddenly}: adverbial of manner
    \item \textbf{there}: adverbial of place
    \item \textbf{beautifully}: adverbial of manner
    \item \textbf{very cordially}: adverbial of manner
    \item \textbf{for about half an hour}: adverbial of time
    \item \textbf{together}: adverbial of manner
    \item \textbf{within a short time}: adverbial of time
    \item \textbf{never}: adverbial of frequency
    \item \textbf{every day}: adverbial of frequency
    \item \textbf{almost regularly}: adverbial of frequency
\end{itemize}
