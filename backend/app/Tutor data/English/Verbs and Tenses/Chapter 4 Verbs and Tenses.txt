\part{Simple Present and Present Continuous}

You have already learned about verbs and tenses in your earlier classes. This unit focuses on some of the verb forms, especially tenses and modals that often cause confusion and difficulties for our students learning English.

\subsection*{The Simple Present}

\textbf{A.} Read the following text and then underline all the verbs in the simple present tense.

Mr. Selim Ahmed and his wife Laila Banu \textbf{live} in a small independent house in the suburb of Khulna town. They \textbf{are} in their mid-forties. Mr. Ahmed \textbf{is} a writer. Unlike his neighbours and friends, Mr. Ahmed mostly \textbf{stays} and \textbf{works} at home. That \textbf{is} not to say that he \textbf{works} less and \textbf{enjoys} more free time than anybody else. He \textbf{tries} to follow a strict schedule and usually \textbf{works} for ten to twelve hours a day. Every day with the break of the dawn he \textbf{sits} down at his desk and \textbf{starts} writing on his computer. In the afternoons, he often \textbf{helps} his wife in her garden. Sometimes he \textbf{goes} for long walks in the countryside. But he always \textbf{comes} back before dusk.

\textbf{Grammar Point}

\textbf{Form:} The simple present is formed by a main verb without an auxiliary:

I \textbf{teach} English at a college. She \textbf{works} in a bank.

\textbf{Making a question in the simple present:}

When we make a question in the simple present with the verb \textit{be}, we put the subject after the verb: He \textbf{is} a writer. \textbf{Is} he a writer?

With other verbs, we add the auxiliary \textit{do/does} before the subject and the main verb (in the infinitive): He \textbf{teaches} English. \textbf{Does} he \textbf{teach} English? They \textbf{live} in Khulna. \textbf{Do} they \textbf{live} in Khulna?

If we are using an auxiliary or modal (\textit{is}, \textit{will}, \textit{have}, \textit{can}, etc.) in a question, we put the subject after the auxiliary or modal:

He \textbf{is} reading. \textbf{Is} he \textbf{reading}?\\
He \textbf{can} swim well. \textbf{Can} he \textbf{swim} well?

\textbf{Making a negative:} To make the negative of \textit{be}, we can add \textit{not} or \textit{n't} to the main verb:

I \textbf{am} a teacher. I \textbf{am not} a teacher.\\
He \textbf{is} an artist. He \textbf{is not/isn't} an artist.\\
They \textbf{are} friends. They \textbf{are not/aren't} friends.

To make negatives of other verbs, we use \textit{do not/does not} plus infinitive:

I \textbf{play} football. I \textbf{do not play} football.\\
He \textbf{works} in a bank. He \textbf{does not work} in a bank.

\textbf{Use}

We use simple present for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Facts and descriptions: Milk \textbf{is} white. I \textbf{am} a teacher. She \textbf{likes} romantic movies.
    \item Situations we see as long-term or permanent: Tanim \textbf{lives} in Dhaka. He \textbf{works} in a business firm.
    \item Habits and repeated actions: She \textbf{takes} the bus to work. She usually \textbf{visits} her parents on Fridays.
    \item Schedules and time-tables: The train \textbf{leaves} at 7 a.m. tomorrow. The exams \textbf{start} next week.
    \item Statements about the future after `when' and `if': When/If I \textbf{see} her tomorrow, I \textbf{'ll tell} her everything.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Note:} When we use the simple present to talk about something which happens frequently or regularly, we often use a frequency adverb such as \textit{often}, \textit{always}, \textit{usually}, \textit{once a week}, etc., e.g.

He \textbf{always reads} the newspaper in the morning.\\
She \textbf{often cooks} meals for her room-mate.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the text in Presentation (A) again and find sentences with verbs in simple present that talk about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Facts and description
    \item Situations not expected to change
    \item Repeated or frequent events
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 2}

Write questions for the following answers.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mr. Ahmed \textbf{is} a writer. \_\_
    \item He usually \textbf{gets} up early in the morning. \_\_
    \item No, he mostly \textbf{works} at home. \_\_
    \item Mrs. Ahmed \textbf{grows} vegetables in her garden. \_\_
    \item They \textbf{are} in their mid-forties. \_\_
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 3}

The words in the following sentences are jumbled up. Arrange the words in proper order to make meaningful sentences.

\begin{itemize}
    \item often to library the he \textbf{goes} \_\_
    \item romantic she novels \textbf{reads} usually \_\_
    \item football once a week \textbf{play} we \_\_
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 4}

In the left-hand column below, there are eight sentences in the simple present. In the right-hand column, there are eight contexts. In the blanks, write the letter of the statement that goes with each sentence.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
1. He \textbf{goes} jogging in the morning every day. & a. present situation \\
2. Oil \textbf{floats} on water. & b. habits \\
3. The train to Sylhet \textbf{leaves} at 11 a.m. & c. routine actions \\
4. She \textbf{collects} coins. & d. general truths \\
5. ... and ... yes Mushfequr \textbf{makes} a boundary! & e. statements about the future after when/if \\
6. They \textbf{work} in a garments factory. & f. schedule/timetables \\
7. I \textbf{'ll explain} it to her when she \textbf{comes} back. & g. newspaper headlines on recent events \\
8. The President \textbf{meets} the EU delegates. & h. commentaries on sports or current events \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{The Present Continuous}

\textbf{A.} Read the text below and underline the verbs in present continuous.

This afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Ahmed \textbf{are working} in the garden. The weather \textbf{is} lovely. Mrs. Ahmed \textbf{is sitting} on a tree stump while Mr. Ahmed \textbf{is cleaning} the weeds from the tomato beds nearby. Mrs. Ahmed \textbf{looks} happy. Mr. Ahmed \textbf{is spending} a lot of time with her helping in the garden these days. They \textbf{are talking} about their daughters Maya and Sneha who \textbf{are coming} home for a week's vacation from Dhaka tomorrow. The train \textbf{arrives} at 8 in the morning. Mrs. Ahmed \textbf{is telling} her husband not to tell the girls anything about her garden. She \textbf{wonders} how surprised and happy they will be when they see her gorgeous tomatoes and the lettuce!

\textbf{Grammar Point}

\textbf{Form}

The present continuous is formed by the auxiliary verb \textit{be} (\textit{am}, \textit{is}, or \textit{are}) plus the -ing form of the main verb:

It \textbf{is raining}. Rina and Karim \textbf{are listening} to music.

\textbf{Making questions and negatives in the present continuous:}

To make a question, we usually put the auxiliary verb \textit{be} before the subject:

He \textbf{is studying}. \textbf{Is} he \textbf{studying}?\\
The boys \textbf{are swimming}. \textbf{Are} the boys \textbf{swimming}?

\textit{Note:} But if \textit{what}, \textit{who}, \textit{how many}, etc. is the subject, then we put the subject before the auxiliary:

\textbf{Who is coming} for dinner tonight?\\
\textbf{What is bothering} you?

To make a negative in the present continuous, we can add \textit{not} or \textit{n't} to the \textit{be} verb:

I \textbf{am not/I'm not doing} anything. We/you/they \textbf{are not/aren't working}.

\textbf{Use}

We use the present continuous to talk about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Things which are happening now: I \textbf{'m having} lunch right now. Laila \textbf{is talking} on the phone.
    \item Things which are happening during this period of time, but not necessarily at the moment: She \textbf{is working} very hard these days. She \textbf{is attending} a training programme.
    \item Repeated events: My two sons \textbf{are always fighting}. She \textbf{is always losing} things.
    \item Things that people plan to do in the future: Rina \textbf{is going} to the museum tomorrow. We \textbf{are leaving} for London next week.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the passage in Presentation-A again and discuss in pairs in what sense each of the verbs in the present continuous has been used.

\textbf{Activity 2}

Fill in the blanks in the following sentences with the appropriate form (simple present or the present continuous) of the verbs in the brackets:

a. I usually \_\_ (enjoy) Chinese food, but I \_\_ (not/enjoy) this meal.\\
b. Can you drive? No, but I \_\_ (learn) now. A friend \_\_ (teach) me.\\
c. On weekends Karim usually \_\_ (take) his children to the amusement park, but today he \_\_ (take) them to the zoo.\\
d. Why \_\_ that man \_\_ (stand) in the middle of the road? He \_\_ (try) to get across. He \_\_ (wait) for a gap in the traffic. Why \_\_ he \_\_ (not use) the subway? Lots of people \_\_ (not bother) to use the subway. They \_\_ (prefer) to risk their lives crossing here.\\
e. \_\_ You \_\_ (go) out tonight? No, I \_\_ (stay) home. A friend \_\_ (come) to watch TV.

\subsection*{Verbs Not Used in the Continuous}

\textbf{A.} Read the following conversation. Notice the verbs in bold. These are all in the simple present form, although they tell us about something that is happening now.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Do} you \textbf{smell} anything? I'm sure something \textbf{is burning}.
    \item I \textbf{can hear} people screaming! I \textbf{can hear} cracking sounds too!
    \item Look! \textbf{Do} you \textbf{see} smoke coming out of that building?
    \item Oh no! I \textbf{think} that building \textbf{is} on fire! Why \textbf{does}n't anyone \textbf{call} the Fire Brigade?
    \item I \textbf{think} someone \textbf{has}. I \textbf{can hear} the bells!
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Grammar Point}

We use verbs which describe an action or situation in the present continuous to talk about something happening now:

I \textbf{am listening} to music. Amir \textbf{is playing} in the garden. Mom \textbf{is cooking} dinner.

\textbf{Verbs not used in the continuous:}

We don't use the present continuous with verbs which we use to describe people or things:

Amina \textbf{is} at school. (NOT Amina \textbf{is being} at school.)\\
I \textbf{like} this painting. (NOT I \textbf{'m liking} this painting.)\\
But I \textbf{don't understand} it. (NOT But I \textbf{am not understanding} it.)\\
\textbf{Do} you \textbf{love} him? (NOT \textbf{Are} you \textbf{loving} him?)

Verbs which are not usually used in the continuous form fall under the categories of sense verbs, state verbs, emotion verbs, possession verbs, and other.

\textbf{B.} Look at the chart below showing different categories of verbs that do not usually take the continuous form.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\textbf{Sense Verbs} & \textbf{State of Mind} & \textbf{Emotion Verbs} & \textbf{Possession Verbs} & \textbf{Other} \\
hear & believe & want & belong & need \\
taste & remember & love & own & matter \\
feel & know & like & have & exist \\
smell & prefer & hate & possess & appear \\
see & seem & hope & contain & \\
recognise & think & desire & & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textit{Note:} \textit{can} is often used with sense words such as \textit{hear}, \textit{see}, \textit{feel}, \textit{smell}, and \textit{taste}.

\textbf{C.} \textbf{Exceptions}

However, some of the above verbs can be used in the continuous form. For example, \textit{be}, \textit{have}, \textit{think}, and \textit{appear}. We can use the continuous form of these verbs only when they mean action.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{be}: Karim \textbf{is} an intelligent boy. (state: description) But I \textbf{don't understand} why he \textbf{'s being} so irrational about this whole issue. (acting or behaving in a certain way)
    \item \textit{have}: They \textbf{have} a beautiful house. (state: possession) She \textbf{is having} breakfast. (action: eating)
    \item \textit{think}: I \textbf{think} Naila \textbf{is} hard-working. (opinion: state of mind) I \textbf{am thinking} about what to do next. (action: planning)
    \item \textit{appear}: He \textbf{appears} to be quite disturbed. (state: description) She \textbf{is appearing} at the theatre this evening. (action: taking part)
\end{itemize}

\textit{look} and \textit{feel}: can be used in either the simple or the continuous to talk about something happening now:

I \textbf{feel} tired/I \textbf{am feeling} tired.\\
She \textbf{looks} gorgeous/She \textbf{is looking} gorgeous.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the passage and choose the right form of verb.

It \textbf{is/being} guava season. Mariam \textbf{plucks/is plucking} guavas in her orchard. The guavas \textbf{are looking/look} fresh and juicy. They \textbf{are smelling/smell} sweet and delicious. Mariam \textbf{is being/is} very happy. She \textbf{goes/is going} to make jelly with it. But she \textbf{is needing/needs} to buy sugar and some other things. She \textbf{is hating/hates} going to the market. She \textbf{is thinking/thinks} who to send to the market. Suddenly she \textbf{is remembering/remembers} that her sister-in-law \textbf{loves/is loving} to go shopping. Maybe she \textbf{will ask} her to buy the things.

\textbf{Activity 2}

Read the following text and fill in the blanks with the right form (simple present or present continuous) of verbs in the brackets.

Jack \_\_ (love) Nina. But Nina \_\_ (say) that she \_\_ (like) Jack, but \_\_ (not love) him. However, Jack \_\_ (not believe) her. He \_\_ (think) Nina \_\_ (lie). She only \_\_ (want) to test him. He \_\_ (not understand) how \_\_ Nina \_\_ (not love) him when he \_\_ (love) her so much.

\part{Present Perfect and Present Perfect Continuous}

\subsection*{The Present Perfect Simple}

\textbf{A.} Read the mini-dialogues below. Notice the verbs in bold. They are all in the present perfect simple.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a: I \textbf{have made} a terrible mistake!\\
    \textbf{:} That's not surprising. You \textbf{are always making} mistakes. What \textbf{have} you \textbf{done}?\\
    \textbf{:} I \textbf{'ve forgotten} to pay my exam fees. Yesterday was the last date.
    \item b: \textbf{Have} you \textbf{ever seen} a peacock?\\
    \textbf{:} Yes, I \textbf{have}. In fact I \textbf{'ve seen} quite a few of them.\\
    \textbf{:} Oh really! Where \textbf{did} you \textbf{see} them?\\
    \textbf{:} I \textbf{saw} them in Rajasthan while I \textbf{was} in India last year.
    \item c: \textbf{Have} you \textbf{ever been} to Nepal?\\
    \textbf{:} No, I \textbf{haven't}. \textbf{Have} you?\\
    \textbf{:} Yes, I \textbf{have}. I \textbf{went} there with my parents a few years back.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Grammar Point}

\textbf{Form}

We make the present perfect simple by using \textit{have/has} with the past participle of the main verb:

Sagar \textbf{has posted} the letter.\\
We \textbf{have bought} some chocolate.\\
He \textbf{has had} a bad day today.

To make a question, we use the auxiliary verb \textit{have/has}, then the subject, followed by the past participle of the main verb:

\textbf{Has} she \textbf{taken} her medicine?\\
\textbf{Have} you \textbf{talked} to Shyamal?

We make the negative by adding \textit{not/n't} after the auxiliary \textit{have/has}:

I \textbf{'ve bought} the book, but \textbf{haven't read} it yet.\\
He \textbf{hasn't watched} TV today.

\textbf{Use}

We use the present perfect to talk about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our experience, or an event which happened at some time in our lives: I \textbf{'ve been} to New York. \textbf{Have} you \textbf{ever played} tennis?
    \item Something that happened very recently: \textbf{Have} you \textbf{heard} the news? Kiran \textbf{has got} a first class! The plane \textbf{has just landed}.
    \item Recent events or actions, the results of which are still relevant: She \textbf{isn't} here. She \textbf{has already left}. Reza \textbf{has bought} a flat in Uttara. (He owns it now)
\end{itemize}

\textit{Note:} \textit{has/have gone} and \textit{has/have been} have different meanings:

She \textbf{has gone} home. (= She is at home now.)\\
I \textbf{'ve been} to Nepal. (= I've visited Nepal. I am not there now.)

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the following dialogues and put the right form (simple present or present perfect) of verbs (in the brackets) in the blanks.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a: Look! I \_\_ (buy) the latest novel of Selina Hossain for you, I \_\_ (hope) you \_\_ (not have) a copy already.\\
    \textbf{:} No, I \textbf{haven't}. Thanks a lot. \_\_ you \_\_ (read) it?
    \item b: \_\_ you \_\_ (hear) about Jonathan?\\
    \textbf{:} No, I \_\_ (not see) him recently. What \_\_ (happen)?\\
    \textbf{:} He \_\_ (get) a job in Australia.\\
    \textbf{:} \_\_ his family \_\_ (know)? \_\_ he \_\_ (tell) his wife?
    \item c: Darling, I \_\_ (get) something important to tell you.\\
    \textbf{:} \_\_ you \_\_ (hear) anything from Australia?\\
    \textbf{:} Yes, they \_\_ (offer) me the job.\\
    \textbf{:} What \_\_ you \_\_ (want) to do? What about your job here?\\
    \textbf{:} I \_\_ (decide) to go. I \_\_ (send) my resignation letter this morning, and \_\_ (put up) an ad in today's newspaper to sell the car too.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Present Perfect Continuous}

\textbf{A.} Read the following conversations. Can you identify the verbs in the present perfect continuous?

\begin{itemize}
    \item a: Hello, Shahan! What \textbf{have} you \textbf{been doing}? You \textbf{look} so tired and irritated.\\
    \textbf{:} Oh I \textbf{have been trying} to fix my cycle for the last three hours.\\
    \textbf{:} \textbf{Have} you \textbf{fixed} it?\\
    \textbf{:} No, I \textbf{couldn't}. All my efforts \textbf{have been} useless.
    \item b: Sorry, I'm late. \textbf{Have} you \textbf{been waiting} for long?\\
    \textbf{:} That's ok. I \textbf{'ve been watching} the news while I \textbf{waited}.
    \item c: Hello, Shila. This is Mark here. Is Nina there? We \textbf{'ve been waiting} for her at the library since 3 o'clock.\\
    \textbf{:} Sorry, Mark. Nina \textbf{is not} here. She \textbf{has just left}.\\
    \textbf{:} \textbf{Do} you \textbf{know} where she \textbf{has gone}? I \textbf{don't really understand} ... she \textbf{has been acting} strangely these days.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Grammar Point}

\textbf{Form}

The present perfect continuous is formed by \textit{has/have} + \textit{been} + verb-ing:

I \textbf{have been typing} for three hours.\\
He \textbf{has been practising} for the match every day.\\
They \textbf{have been waiting} for her since 3 o'clock.

We usually use the contracted form (I’ve, he’s), especially when we speak.

For questions and negatives we use the following forms respectively:

\textbf{Has} Tito \textbf{been studying} all morning? \textbf{Have} you \textbf{been watching} TV?\\
You \textbf{haven't been listening}.\\
The buses \textbf{haven't been running} on time today.

\textbf{Use}

We use the present perfect continuous to talk about a situation or an activity which started in the past and is on-going or not completed. We often use a time phrase to say how long by using \textit{for} or \textit{since}:

Tina \textbf{has been cooking} since morning.\\
Shamim \textbf{has been talking} to his lawyer for over an hour.

\begin{itemize}
    \item We also use the present perfect continuous for an activity that began in the past and has very recently finished: I \textbf{'ve been cleaning} the kitchen. (I'm still sweating, and I still have the gloves on.) The two boys \textbf{have been fighting} again. (The room is a terrible mess.)
    \item We also use it for repeated events up to now: I \textbf{'ve been playing} the guitar since I was seven. Dr. Sayeed \textbf{has been treating} my father for years.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the descriptions and write a sentence for each one about what has happened or have been happening.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a. Selim is sitting at his study table. He is writing an essay on The Pleasure of Reading. He started writing two hours ago. Selim \_\_ two hours.
    \item b. It is 10 in the morning. Laila is in the garden digging the soil and preparing the beds to plant her winter vegetables. She started working at 8 a.m. Laila \_\_ 8 a.m.
    \item c. Rana is a swimming instructor. He is in the pool now training a ten year old boy. He still has twenty minutes before he finishes training the boy. He trains him for thirty minutes. Rana \_\_ the boy \_\_.
    \item d. Andrew and his wife Sara came to Bangladesh ten years ago. They still live in Dhaka. They \_\_ in Dhaka \_\_ ten years.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 2}

Read the following conversation and fill in the blanks with the right form (present perfect/present perfect continuous) of verbs in brackets.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{:} Hello, Jack! \_\_ you \_\_ (have) a good nap?\\
    \textbf{:} No, I \textbf{haven’t}.\\
    \textbf{:} Why? What \_\_ (happen)?\\
    \textbf{:} For one thing, Nina \_\_ (play) the radio too loud.\\
    \textbf{:} Oh dear! You should have told her to turn down the volume.\\
    \textbf{:} Then the children next door \_\_ (make) a terrible noise since after lunch. They \_\_ (scream, shout and fight) for the last one and a half hours.\\
    \textbf{:} Come on, dear, relax. I’m going to make you a cup of tea.\\
    \textbf{:} How can I relax? I \_\_ (get) a terrible headache.\\
    \textbf{:} A cup of tea will make you feel better. And I think the children \_\_ finally \_\_ (stop) shouting and screaming too.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 3}

Discuss in groups and try to explain the difference in meaning of the following sentence pairs.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Who has been stealing} my marbles? \textbf{Who has stolen} my marbles?
    \item \textbf{It’s been raining} for an hour. \textbf{Look! It’s been raining}.
    \item \textbf{The manager has spoken} to Kalam. \textbf{The manager has been speaking} to Kalam for an hour.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Present Perfect Versus Past Simple}

\textbf{A.} Read the following dialogues and notice the verb forms in bold.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a: \textbf{Have} you \textbf{been} to Sri Lanka?\\
    \textbf{:} Yes, I \textbf{have}.\\
    \textbf{:} When \textbf{did} you \textbf{go}?\\
    \textbf{:} I \textbf{went} there last year, during the summer vacation.
    \item b: \textbf{Have} you \textbf{read} Zia Hasan’s new novel?\\
    \textbf{:} No, I \textbf{haven’t}. \textbf{Have} you?\\
    \textbf{:} Oh, yes. It \textbf{’s} great!\\
    \textbf{:} When \textbf{did} you \textbf{read} it?\\
    \textbf{:} Last week. I \textbf{borrowed} it from Riaz.
    \item c: \textbf{Have} you \textbf{talked} to Nina recently?\\
    \textbf{:} Yes, I \textbf{have}. She \textbf{called} me yesterday. In fact, we \textbf{talked} for a long time.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Use}

We use the present perfect to talk about our experiences, about something we have done in our life up to now, often used with \textit{ever} or \textit{never}. Note that the focus is on \textit{what}, not \textit{when}.

When we ask \textit{when} or the focus is on a specific time which is past, we use the past tense of the verb.

\textbf{Activity 1}

In each pair of sentences below, one sentence uses the simple past tense and one sentence uses the present perfect. Work in groups and try to explain the difference in meaning between the two sentences in each pair.

\begin{itemize}
    \item We \textbf{have known} about the problem for ages. He \textbf{knew} about the problem for ages.
    \item We \textbf{have been waiting} for you since 3 o’clock. I \textbf{waited} for you from 3 o’clock.
    \item \textbf{Have} you \textbf{seen} the movie? \textbf{Did} you \textbf{see} the movie?
    \item \textbf{Have} you \textbf{ever been} to Cox’s Bazar? \textbf{Did} you \textbf{go} to Cox’s Bazar?
\end{itemize}

\part{Simple Past and Past Continuous}

\subsection*{The Simple Past}

\textbf{A.} Read the following text. Underline the verbs in it and notice the time they refer to.

Phil Johnson’s father \textbf{owned} a laundry, so he \textbf{gave} his son a job hoping the boy \textbf{would work} into the business. But Phil \textbf{hated} the laundry, so he \textbf{dawdled}, \textbf{loafed} and \textbf{did} what he \textbf{had} to do only. Some days he \textbf{was} absent. His father \textbf{was} so hurt to think he \textbf{had} a shiftless, ambitionless son that he \textbf{was} actually ashamed before his employees.

One day Phil Johnson \textbf{told} his father he \textbf{wanted} to be a mechanic – \textbf{work} in a machine shop. The old man \textbf{was} shocked. But Phil \textbf{had} his way. He \textbf{did} much harder work than he \textbf{had} to do in the laundry. He \textbf{worked} longer hours, and he \textbf{whistled} at his job! He \textbf{took} up engineering, \textbf{learned} about engines – and when Philip Johnson \textbf{died}, in 1944, he \textbf{was} president of Trademark Company.

\textbf{Grammar Point}

\textbf{Form}

The simple past is the past tense form that uses the main verb without an auxiliary. For most verbs in English, the simple past tense is formed with the ending -ed to the infinitive of the verb:

\textbf{look-looked} \textbf{talk-talked}

But some verbs are different and they don’t end with -ed in their past form. These are called irregular verbs:

\textbf{go-went} \textbf{make-made} \textbf{take-took}

The verb \textit{be} has a different past simple form:

\textbf{be - was/were}

To make a question with \textit{be} in the past simple, we usually put the verb before the subject:

\textbf{Was} he a clerk in the bank?\\
\textbf{Were} Taniya and Reza class mates?\\
\textbf{Where were} you yesterday?

To make questions with other verbs in the simple past, we usually use \textit{did} + subject + infinitive:

\textbf{Did} you \textbf{buy} that book?\\
\textbf{When did} he \textbf{visit} England?\\
\textbf{Why did} he \textbf{go} there?

To make a negative, we add \textit{not/n't} to \textit{was/were} and \textit{did}:

No, he \textbf{wasn’t} a clerk in the bank.\\
They \textbf{weren’t} class mates.\\
He \textbf{did not visit} England.\\
We \textbf{didn’t see} you in the theatre last evening.\\
\textbf{Why didn’t} you \textbf{come}?

\textbf{Use}

We use the past simple to talk about an action or happening at a definite time in the past:

I \textbf{mailed} the letter yesterday.\\
I \textbf{met} her two years ago.

We often use the simple past with expressions such as \textit{yesterday}, \textit{last week}, \textit{in 1952}, \textit{when I was in school}, \textit{three days ago}, etc.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Underline the irregular verbs in the Presentation above (A), and then write down the present form of the verbs.

\textbf{Activity 2}

Use the right form of verbs given below to complete the following passage from the life story of Helen Keller. One is done for you:

\begin{tabular}{llll}
leave & know & live & come \\
find & write & cannot say & can \\
feel & discover & help & need \\
\end{tabular}

When she was one and a half years old, Helen \textbf{became} ill. This sickness \textbf{left} her blind and deaf. Since she could hear no sounds, she \textbf{did not learn} to talk.

Helen \_\_ in a dark and silent world for more than five years. In this world without sound, she \_\_ only what she could touch and smell and taste. She \_\_ hunger and cold, but she \_\_ to herself, “I am hungry.” She \_\_, “I am cold”.

Helen \_\_ not \_\_ the secret of language. She \_\_ not \_\_ with other human beings. But because she \_\_ human, she \_\_ to communicate. Helen finally \_\_ the secret of language. Years later, she \_\_ a book about her life.

When Helen was seven years old, Anne Sullivan, a teacher \_\_ to live in her house. Miss Sullivan \_\_ a way to lead Helen out of her sightless, soundless world. This woman \_\_ Helen to \_\_ the secret of language.

\textbf{Activity 3}

Write questions for the following answers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I \textbf{studied} law. \_\_
    \item I \textbf{graduated} in 2010. \_\_
    \item At the university of New Castle. \_\_
    \item Well, I \textbf{met} Paul at the university. We \textbf{were} both in the same class. \_\_
    \item No, he \textbf{didn’t finish} his studies. \_\_
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Past Continuous}

\textbf{A.} Read the passage carefully and notice that there are verbs in both the simple past and the past continuous forms.

It \textbf{was} 4 in the afternoon. Hamid \textbf{was studying} at the library when his cell phone \textbf{rang}. It \textbf{was} his younger sister, Runa. She \textbf{said} that she \textbf{was standing} in front of the shopping mall opposite Hamid’s office and \textbf{asked} him to meet her there as soon as possible. Hamid \textbf{hurried} out of the library. As he \textbf{went} across the street, he \textbf{noticed} that Runa \textbf{was} not alone. She \textbf{was holding} a three to four year old girl by hand. The child \textbf{was crying} and Runa \textbf{was trying} frantically to pacify her. He \textbf{just couldn’t imagine} what \textbf{was going} on. Some passers-by \textbf{were looking} at them suspiciously. When he \textbf{reached} her, she \textbf{started} to explain, but before she \textbf{could finish} – the child \textbf{suddenly left} her hand, and \textbf{was running} towards a woman who \textbf{was coming} out of the mall \textbf{crying} and \textbf{calling} a girl’s name hysterically.

\textbf{Grammar Point}

\textbf{Form}

We make the past continuous by using the past of the auxiliary verb \textit{be} (\textit{was}, \textit{were}) and the -ing form of the main verb:

She \textbf{was talking}. They \textbf{were arguing}.

We make questions by putting the auxiliary verb (\textit{was}, \textit{were}) before the subject:

\textbf{Was} she \textbf{crying}?\\
\textbf{Why were} they \textbf{arguing}?

And we make negatives, by adding \textit{not/n't} to \textit{was/were}:

She \textbf{wasn’t shopping}. They \textbf{weren’t working}.

\textbf{Use}

We use the past continuous to talk about things which were in progress at, or during, a particular time in the past:

At 4 o’clock I \textbf{was studying} at the library.\\
At that time yesterday, my friends \textbf{were playing} football in school.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Write down the questions for the following answers.

\begin{itemize}
    \item I \textbf{was waiting} for the bus at about \underline{4.30} today. \_\_
    \item Yes, while I \textbf{was waiting}, I \textbf{was talking} on the phone. \_\_
    \item I \textbf{was talking} with a friend. \_\_
    \item Before that? I \textbf{don’t remember} what I \textbf{was doing} before that. \_\_
    \item Yes, I \textbf{was studying} at the library. Why are you asking me these questions? \_\_
    \item Of course I’m sure. I \textbf{was not having} tea with Salma after lunch at the canteen. \_\_
    \item Well, I \textbf{last saw} her yesterday when she \textbf{was coming} out of her class. \_\_
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 2}

Read the following passage. Some of the verb forms and/or the spellings are not correct. Identify them and write the correct forms.

Yesterday \textbf{was} my birthday. I \textbf{thought} that no one \textbf{will remember} it. But when I \textbf{waked} up in the morning, I \textbf{found} a brand new copy of Jule Vernes’ \textit{Journey to the Centre of the Earth} on the table next to my bed. It \textbf{had} a note stuck on it ‘For my dearest son, with love. Abbu.’ I \textbf{springed} out of the bed with excitement. As I \textbf{was get} dressed, I \textbf{heared} mother \textbf{calling} everyone for breakfast. I \textbf{got} dressed quickly and \textbf{went} to the dining room. My mother \textbf{comes} towards me and \textbf{says}, “Happy Birthday, darling. Here! I \textbf{buyed} this alarm clock for you....”. But before she \textbf{could finish} what she \textbf{is saying}, my little sister \textbf{cryed} out, “Bhaiya, now you \textbf{won’t have} any excuse for \textbf{being} late at the breakfast table.”

\subsection*{Used to and the Past Tense}

\textbf{A.} Read the following passage and notice the verbs in bold.

I \textbf{met} Hasan yesterday almost after ten years. He \textbf{was} my closest friend in school. He \textbf{was} the only child of his parents. His father \textbf{used to worry} a lot about who his friends \textbf{were} or where he \textbf{was going}. But our two families \textbf{were} on friendly terms and Hasan and I \textbf{used to spend} a lot of time together. We \textbf{were} very happy to see each other after such a long time and \textbf{started} talking about all the things we \textbf{used to do} as children: how we \textbf{used to go} cycling in the countryside after school, or \textbf{go} swimming in the pond by the Town Hall on weekends. But of course Ali bhai \textbf{would} always \textbf{be} there with us on those occasions. Ali bhai \textbf{used to work} in Hasan’s father’s garments factory.

\textbf{Grammar Point}

\textbf{Form}

\textit{Used to} + infinitive to talk about past habits and long-term situations that do not exist now:

In winter, we \textbf{used to sit} around a wood stove in the veranda and \textbf{listen} to grandma’s stories. (We don’t do it anymore.)

\textbf{Use}

We use \textit{used to} in the same way as the past simple, but only to talk about what we did often or regularly:

Ten years ago I \textbf{used to work} on a type writer. (I use a computer now.)\\
There \textbf{used to be} a park in this place. But it’s not there now.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Make sentences with the following prompts using ‘\textit{used to}’.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Before} & \textbf{Now} \\
play cricket and tennis & tennis only \\
read books a lot & no time/ only newspaper \\
scared of ghost stories & write horror stories \\
go to movies & watch TV at home \\
\end{tabular}

(Example: Karim \textbf{used to go} to movies regularly, but now he \textbf{watches} TV at home.)

\textbf{Activity 2}

Write down about three to five things you \textit{used to} do as a child that you don’t do now. You may follow the model of the example given above.

\textbf{Activity 3}

Read the following text. Notice that the underlined verbs are all in the past tense. Some of these can be changed to ‘\textit{used to} + base form of verb’. Change them and write the ‘\textit{used to}’ form in the gaps. For the verbs you cannot change, write down \textit{no change}. Two are done for you.

The school I \underline{\textbf{went}} (1) to when I \underline{\textbf{was}} (2) at the primary level \textbf{had} (3) a tin-roofed building. It \underline{\textbf{had}} (4) a big playground in front. During the tiffin break, we \underline{\textbf{played}} (5) ‘kabadi’. We \underline{\textbf{made}} (6) so much noise that the headmaster \textbf{would} often \textbf{come} out of his office and \textbf{warn} us. Most of the time, we \underline{\textbf{wouldn’t hear}} (7) the bell go and \underline{\textbf{got}} (8) scolded by our teacher. During the rainy season, we \underline{\textbf{enjoyed}} (9) playing football the most. We \underline{\textbf{got}} (10) drenched in the rain.

Last year when I \underline{\textbf{went}} (11) to visit my school after many years, I \underline{\textbf{found}} (12) that instead of the tin-roofed building there \textbf{stood} a multi-storied building. But I \underline{\textbf{was}} (13) happy to see that the old playground \underline{\textbf{was}} (14) still where it \underline{\textbf{was}} (15). The school authority \textbf{didn’t construct} any new building there. Maybe they \underline{\textbf{still cared}} (16) for their students as they \underline{\textbf{did}} (17) before.

\part{Past Perfect and Future Expressions}

\subsection*{The Past Perfect and The Past Perfect Continuous}

\textbf{A.} Read the following text.

Habib made the following entries in his diary last Monday. Read them.

\begin{itemize}
    \item 11 am Nargis \textbf{left} Dhaka for Sylhet by car.
    \item 11.15 I \textbf{reached} her house fifteen minutes late.
    \item 1.30 I \textbf{called} her on cell phone. She \textbf{was} near Ashuganj.
    \item 6.00 She \textbf{reached} Sylhet and \textbf{called} me.
    \item 7.30 I \textbf{spoke} to her again. She \textbf{was cooking} dinner.
\end{itemize}

Now see how Habib reported the whole thing to Salma a few days later.

When I \textbf{reached} Nargis’ house at 11.15, she \textbf{had already left} home for Sylhet. She \textbf{had waited} for me till 11.00 and then \textbf{left} with her father in their family car. When I \textbf{talked} to her at 1.30 pm, she \textbf{hadn’t yet reached} Ashuganj, but \textbf{was} close to it. At 6.00 she \textbf{called} to say that she \textbf{had just reached} Sylhet.

When I \textbf{called} her again at 7.30, she \textbf{had already unpacked} and \textbf{was cooking} dinner. I \textbf{told} her how miserable I \textbf{was feeling} because I \textbf{hadn’t said} ‘good bye’ to her before she \textbf{left}. She \textbf{laughed} softly and \textbf{said} she \textbf{understood}.

\textbf{B.} Following is a typical evening at work for Dr. Akram, a general physician. Read the sentences carefully:

Like any other day, yesterday also Dr. Akram \textbf{saw} patients from 5 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. As usual, he \textbf{started} with the emergency cases first. From 5 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. he \textbf{saw} four patients. That is, by 6.30 he \textbf{had seen} four patients. From 6.30 to 9 p.m. he \textbf{saw} eight patients. From 9 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. he \textbf{saw} another six patients. That means by 10.30 the doctor \textbf{had seen} eighteen patients.

He \textbf{had been seeing} patients since 5 o’clock. In other words, by the time it was 10.30, Dr. Akram \textbf{had been seeing} patients for five and a half hours.

How many patients \textbf{had} Dr. Akram \textbf{seen} by 9 p.m.? He \textbf{had seen} twelve patients.

\textbf{Use}

We use the past perfect to describe an action completed before a certain moment in the past:

When I \textbf{reached} her house at 11.15, she \textbf{had already left} for Sylhet. She \textbf{had left} at 11.00.

If two actions happened in the past, the past perfect is often used to show which action happened earlier than the other:

When I \textbf{called} her at 7.30, she \textbf{had already unpacked}.

We use the past perfect continuous for an action that began before a certain point in the past and continued up to that time:

It was 9 p.m. Dr. Akram \textbf{was seeing} a patient. He \textbf{had started} seeing patients at 5 p.m. He \textbf{had been seeing} patients for four hours. He \textbf{had been seeing} patients since 5.00.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the following paragraph and fill in the blanks with the appropriate form (simple past or past perfect) of verbs in the brackets:

Dr. Akram \_\_ (ask) Fahim when the rash \_\_ (start). Fahim \_\_ (say) that he \_\_ (notice) it a week ago. He \_\_ (say) that he \_\_ (go) to another doctor before, but since the rashes \_\_ (get) worse, he \_\_ (come) to Dr. Akram. Dr. Akram \_\_ (want) to see what medicines the other doctor \_\_ (prescribe). Fahim \_\_ (look) for the prescription in his bag, but it \_\_ (be) not there. He \_\_ (realize) that he \_\_ (forget) to bring it. The doctor \_\_ (tell) Fahim to lie down on the couch, and after he \_\_ (examine) him thoroughly, he \_\_ (give) him some new tests to do.

\textbf{Activity 2}

Read the text below and fill in the blanks with the appropriate form (simple past, past perfect, or past perfect continuous) of the verbs given in the brackets:

When we \_\_ (reach) the stadium, it \_\_ (be) already 4 p.m. We \_\_ (find) that a large crowd \_\_ (wait) there for the match to start. People \_\_ (get) into the stadium since 12 noon as everybody \_\_ (want) a good place to sit.

While \_\_ (wait), the crowd \_\_ (shout) to each other from their seats. A noisy atmosphere \_\_ (prevail) then, but as soon as the game \_\_ (start), a sudden hush \_\_ (fall) all over the stadium. People who \_\_ (shout) all this time \_\_ (become) quiet. However when the first goal \_\_ (be) scored, all the noise that \_\_ (prevail) earlier \_\_ (come) back more powerfully than ever.

It \_\_ (be) memorable experience for my friend and I. The team that we \_\_ (support) all along \_\_ (win) the match.

\subsection*{Expressing Future Time}

As some modern English grammar books have pointed out, it is important to be aware that, strictly speaking, English does not have a future tense. Rather the language has a number of verb forms that can be used to express future time, predictions, intentions, promises, etc.

\subsubsection*{Will and Shall}

Read the following conversations and notice the use of \textit{will}, \textit{shall}, and \textit{won’t} to refer to the future time:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a: How old are you, sir?\\
    \textbf{:} I \textbf{’ll be} 56 on the second of next month. I \textbf{’ll retire} next year.\\
    \textbf{:} Well, what \textbf{will} you \textbf{do} after retirement? \textbf{Have} you \textbf{thought} of something?\\
    \textbf{:} No, not really. Maybe I \textbf{will travel} for a while. I \textbf{’ve always wanted} to do that.
    \item b: Oh dear! I \textbf{’ve forgotten} to bring my medicine.\\
    \textbf{:} Don’t worry. I \textbf{’ll go} and \textbf{buy} it for you. There \textbf{’s} a pharmacy down the street.
    \item c: Happy Birthday, Rehana. Here \textbf{’s} a small gift for you. I \textbf{hope} you \textbf{will like} it.\\
    \textbf{:} Oh, thanks a lot. I’m sure I \textbf{will}. Well, everyone \textbf{is} here, except Shihab.\\
    \textbf{:} I \textbf{don’t think} Shihab \textbf{will come}. He \textbf{doesn’t usually go} to any party.
    \item d: Hi Mahin. \textbf{Could} you \textbf{come} and \textbf{help} me with my homework this afternoon?\\
    \textbf{:} I’m sorry, dear. I \textbf{’ve} a class at 5.00. I \textbf{won’t have} time today.
    \item e: \textbf{Have} you \textbf{paid} the bill, Jim? \textbf{Shall} we \textbf{go}?\\
    \textbf{:} Yes, I \textbf{have}. But where \textbf{shall} we \textbf{go} from here?\\
    \textbf{:} Let’s go to Nina’s place.\\
    \textbf{:} That \textbf{will be} great! I \textbf{’ll call} her right now and \textbf{see} if she \textbf{is} home.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Grammar Point}

\textbf{Form}

We can use \textit{will} (or ‘\textit{ll}) + base form of verb to talk about the future. Traditionally this is known as the simple future. We usually use the contracted form in conversation:

I \textbf{’ll finish} the work tomorrow. I’m too tired to do it now.

We use \textit{will not} (\textit{won’t}) in the negative:

The school \textbf{won’t admit} any new student to class-9 from next year.

We usually use \textit{shall} in questions that are suggestions or offers:

\textbf{Shall} we \textbf{go}?\\
\textbf{Shall} I \textbf{get} you something to drink?

\textbf{Use}

We can use \textit{will} for a future fact:

I \textbf{’ll be} 56 next month.\\
I \textbf{’ll retire} next year.

We use \textit{will} for offering to do something:

Don’t worry. I \textbf{’ll buy} the medicine for you.\\
Don’t get up. I \textbf{’ll answer} the phone.

We sometimes use \textit{will} to express hopes or opinions:

I \textbf{hope} you \textbf{’ll like} it. I \textbf{don’t think} he \textbf{will come}.

We use \textit{will} for promises:

Don’t worry. I \textbf{’ll keep} your papers in a safe place.\\
I \textbf{won’t tell} anybody about this.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Complete the following sentences using \textit{will} or \textit{won’t}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a: I \_\_ (explain) the project to you in class tomorrow.\\
    \textbf{:} \_\_ we \_\_ (bring) our books?
    \item b: I’m going to New Zealand for studying.\\
    \textbf{:} Congratulations! I’m sure you \_\_ (meet) many people and \_\_ (make) many friends there. You \_\_ (learn) a lot about a new culture. I only hope you \_\_ (forget) your old friends.
    \item c: Please don’t tell anybody that I’ve told you about the letter.\\
    \textbf{:} I \_\_ (not). \_\_ Karim \_\_ (know) about the letter?
    \item d: \_\_ you \_\_ (know) when the show \_\_ (start) and how long it \_\_ (continue)?\\
    \textbf{:} I think it \_\_ (start) at 7.00 and \_\_ (continue) for more than two hours.
    \item e: Oops! These bags are too heavy.\\
    \textbf{:} \_\_ I \_\_ (carry) one?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Be + Going To}

Read the conversations below and notice how we can use \textit{be going to} + base form of verb to talk about the future:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a: Hi Raihan! What \textbf{are} you \textbf{going to do} next weekend?\\
    \textbf{:} We \textbf{’re going to visit} the Lalbagh Fort. What about you?\\
    \textbf{:} I \textbf{don’t have} any particular plans.\\
    \textbf{:} Why don’t you come with us?\\
    \textbf{:} Oh, thanks Raihan. I \textbf{’ll do} that.
    \item b: Why \textbf{are} you \textbf{taking} the umbrella?\\
    \textbf{:} It \textbf{’s going to rain} any time. Look! There \textbf{are} dark clouds in the sky.
    \item c: Why \textbf{aren’t} you \textbf{leaving} now? You \textbf{’ll be} late for the prize giving ceremony.\\
    \textbf{:} No, I \textbf{won’t}. I \textbf{’m going to take} a taxi.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Grammar Point}

\textbf{Form}

\textit{be going to} + infinitive. We often use the contracted form, ‘\textit{m}/’\textit{s}/’\textit{re going to}, after the subject in a positive sentence, and ‘\textit{m}/’\textit{s}/’\textit{re not going to} or \textit{isn’t/aren’t going to} in a negative sentence:

I \textbf{’m going to revise} the essay later.\\
She \textbf{’s going to take} driving lessons from tomorrow.\\
They \textbf{are going to submit} the report soon.\\
We \textbf{aren’t going to buy} anything in the market.\\
She \textbf{’s not going to wait} for the bus.

\textbf{Use}

We use \textit{going to} to express a future intention, plan or decision that we thought about before the moment of speaking:

I \textbf{’m going to take} a taxi.\\
We \textbf{are going to visit} the Lalbagh Fort.

We use \textit{going to} for things that we believe or predict about the future, often because the present situation or past event gives us reason for our prediction:

That building \textbf{is going to collapse} any time.\\
It \textbf{’s going to rain}.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Put \textit{will} or ‘\textit{m}/’\textit{re}/’\textit{s going to} in the blanks to complete the sentences.

\begin{itemize}

    \textbf{:} I’m sure you \_\_ (love) it.
    \item b: Why \_\_ you \_\_ (work) so hard these days?\\
    \textbf{:} Because I \_\_ (buy) a computer and I \_\_ (need) some extra money.

    \textbf{:} I \textbf{’m going to post} it.
    \item b: What about this parcel?\\
    \textbf{:} I \textbf{’ll post} it.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Other Forms for Future Time}

Read the texts below. Underline the verb forms that you think refer to the future time.

\begin{itemize}

The train to Chattogram \textbf{leaves} at 10.30 p.m.\\
The ceremony \textbf{starts} at 6.00. Guests \textbf{take} their seats by 5.30.\\
