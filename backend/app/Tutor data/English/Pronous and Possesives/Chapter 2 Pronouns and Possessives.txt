\part{Subject and Object Pronouns}

\textbf{A.} Read the following sentences:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Who is she?
    \item I don't know her. Sorry.
    \item I know her. She lives near my place.
    \item She is Meghna.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Subject and Object Pronouns}

\begin{itemize}
    \item This is my bag. Where is yours?
    \item Here is mine. And this is Uttom's.
    \item But I don't see our passports.
    \item This is my passport. Is it your passport?
    \item Oh, yes. Thank you.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Grammar Point:}

Look at the following grid:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\textbf{Subject Pronoun} & \textbf{Object Pronoun} & \textbf{Possessive Adjective} & \textbf{Possessive Pronoun} \\
I & me & my & mine \\
you & you & your & yours \\
he/she/it & him/her/it & his/her/its & his/her/its \\
we & us & our & ours \\
they & them & their & theirs \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

1. When we use a pronoun as the subject of a verb in a sentence, it is called a subject pronoun.

\textbf{Example:}

I was travelling to Savar. On the way suddenly the bus stopped and remained non-moving. I called on the guide of the bus and asked him the reason. He (= the guide of the bus) told me that the tire of the bus got punctured.

2. When we use a pronoun as the object of a verb in a sentence, we call that an object pronoun.

\textbf{Example:}

Rajon is our class captain for this month. I don't like him (=Rajon) that much.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Complete the description of a job by putting in the correct subject or object pronouns.

I work in a restaurant. Three other people work with \_\_ here. \_\_ are Jibon, Sathi, and Bokul. \_\_ all are good friends. Jibon is a good singer. \_\_ always sings and works. I'm a fan of \_\_ singing. Sathi is a little senior to \_\_ \_\_ is a bit serious in everything. If \_\_ make any mistake, \_\_ scolds \_\_ but loves \_\_ a lot too. I don't know \_\_ passion.

Bokul is \_\_ of \_\_ age. Everyone loves Bokul because of \_\_ pleasing personality. Bokul's special quality is \_\_ is never angry with anyone. Our manager doesn't like \_\_ friendship. She keeps an eye on \_\_ always. \_\_ enjoy \_\_ anxiety.

\part{Possessive Adjectives and Pronouns}

\textbf{Use}

We use a possessive adjective to talk about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Things that we own: What are you carrying? This is my passport.
    \item Family members and friends: My brother lives in Indonesia. He is a Micro-Biologist there.
    \item Things that are connected to us: At my school, we learn science subjects through learning by doing. It helps us a lot to understand the theories.
\end{itemize}

We use a possessive pronoun to talk about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Something that belongs to us or is connected with us, without repeating the noun: The navy blue T-shirt is mine (=my T-shirt). Don't take that one please.
    \item When we know which thing we are referring to: My laptop is six months old. How old is yours (=your laptop)?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 2}

Two friends are talking about their exam preparation. Complete their conversation by putting in the correct possessive adjectives and possessive pronouns.

\textbf{Gitanjali:} My situation is also like (7) \_\_. My mom and my sister are helping \_\_ to pull \_\_. As a result of (8) \_\_ collective efforts I'm improving. Yet it's not that easy once you have a gap in study.

\textbf{Gitanjali:} Oh yes, we take care of this park. We don't depend on the local municipality. In fact, it is (9) \_\_ and so we keep it tidy.

\textbf{Kalyani:} Great! You know we have a small organization working on environment. From (10) \_\_ organization we went to other parts of the city. We tried to convince those people that (11) \_\_ parks are (12) \_\_. Yet the result is not always impressive.

\textbf{Gitanjali:} When all start thinking `It is (13) \_\_ maybe the situation will improve.

\part{Reflexive Pronouns}

Read the following sentences:

\begin{itemize}
    \item After we had completed our exams, we organized a party ourselves.
    \item The party was really great. I prepared myself for the party.
    \item Sujata and Ranju sang in the party but they didn't like each other.
\end{itemize}

These are some examples of reflexive pronouns. Now see how reflexive pronouns are formed.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Subject Pronouns} & \textbf{Reflexive Pronouns} \\
I & myself \\
you (singular) & yourself \\
he/she/it & himself/herself/itself \\
we & ourselves \\
you (plural) & yourselves \\
they & themselves \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Use}

1. We use reflexive pronouns with certain verbs: build, cook, do, enjoy, hurt, paint, teach, make, organize.

2. We usually use reflexive pronouns in the following patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Subject + verb + reflexive pronoun: The party was really great. I prepared myself for the party.
    \item Subject + verb + object + reflexive pronoun: After we had completed our exams, we organized a party ourselves.
\end{itemize}

We use reflexive pronouns immediately after the verb to talk about actions or experiences that only affect the subject and none else.

Don't touch the rod. You'll hurt yourself. (It'll hurt none but you.)

We use reflexive pronouns to mean that the activity has been done by no other person than the subject.

She made the ice cream herself. (Nobody else made it.)

We use `each other' to mean that the same action has been done by both the persons.

Joyita and Jalal love each other. (Joyita loves Jalal and Jalal loves Joyita.)

\textbf{Activity 5}

Read the address made by the chief guest at a programme. Complete the text by adding reflexive pronouns in the gaps. The first one is done for you.

I'm very glad to know that the students of this school have arranged this science fair \textbf{themselves}. It's really a classic example of students' creativity and hard work. This programme reminds me of my school days. Then many times we did similar programmes \_\_. It is good to know that Nasreen has innovated how to recycle banana skins to meet nutrition deficiency \_\_. I'm further glad to see Jinia's work \_\_. I congratulate the organizers of the programme as well. You endeavoured to raise fund for the programmes \_\_. And I cannot but give a hand to you. This is really a great school and I must say that this is a great programme to show how students can help the country and help \_\_ for good causes.

\textbf{Activity 6}

\textbf{[finalise our plan, did it, do the carpeting, work, everything, do things]}

\textbf{Dilruba:} Welcome to our new place.

\textbf{Rafiq:} Wow, everything looks so nice. Did you decorate the house \_\_?
