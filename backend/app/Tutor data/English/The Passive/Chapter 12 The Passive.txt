\textbf{Grammar Point}

We use passive when object of the verb is more important than who does the work (subject). Since object is more important in the passive, object is used as subject in the sentence.

It is funny to say - Some people established the school in 1856.\\
So we say - The school was established in 1856.

Read the above texts (1-7) again and see if they prove what is said here (Grammar Point).

\part{Past Simple and Continuous Passive }

Passives are more used in the formal situation such as media reports and public information.

\textbf{Activity 1}

My journey to Kuakata was painful. First of all, I was late to get up from my bed, I \_\_ (take) to the bus stop by a rickshaw but the rickshaw \_\_ (stick) in traffic jam because the road \_\_ (repair). When I got to the bus stand, I \_\_ (tell) that there was a problem and the bus would be late. When the bus came I \_\_ (give) a seat beside some noisy young boys and girls. During the journey all through the passengers \_\_ (entertain) with some cheap music and video. Suddenly the bus \_\_ (stop) by some policemen and it \_\_ (check) thoroughly. It took nearly half an hour. I was inwardly burning. When I arrived at Kuakata after evening, it was raining. I went to hotel where some other tourists were waiting too. We \_\_ (charge) higher than the regular tariff. However, finally I \_\_ (take) to a room. The door \_\_ (unlock) by the porter and I was happy to see the tidy room. I just threw myself in the bed.

\end{itemize}

\part{Passive Sentence Transformation}
We use active or passive depending on what we are most interested in. We use the active if the subject of the verb needs to be focused. But if the action itself is important, then we use passive form.

Sometimes we use \textit{by+agent}, when both action and agent (doer) are important to be focused. For example:

\textbf{Piya:} Look, these paintings are quite interesting, aren’t they?\\
\textbf{Lira:} Sure! They should be. They \textbf{are painted by Jainul Abedin}!\\
\textbf{Piya:} And what about that one – people with big muscles?\\
\textbf{Lira:} You really don’t know? That’s \textbf{painted by SM Sultan}. All figures of Sultan are muscular.

\textbf{Activity 7}

Rewrite these instructions using simple commands instead of the passive.

An A4 size paper needs to be used for this type of experiment. First of all, it has to be torn into four smaller pieces. This is done as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It has to be folded in the middle and then it can be torn into two pieces.
    \item Each piece is folded again across the middle and torn to make a total of four equal-size pieces.
\end{enumerate}

Now one of the pieces is placed on the table with the long sides pointing down. A horizontal line is drawn across the top of the paper about a quarter of the way from the top. Then two vertical lines are drawn downwards from the horizontal line, so that the bottom part of the paper is divided into three equal-size parts.

Next, the paper has to be torn along each of these vertical lines as far as the horizontal line so that three flaps are created. Then the left flap is folded toward you and the right flap is folded away from you – the folds are made right at the top of the flap. The centre flap should not be folded, though.

Now a paper clip has to be found and this is attached to the bottom of the centre flap. Finally, the whole thing has to be raised high and is then allowed to fall...\\
