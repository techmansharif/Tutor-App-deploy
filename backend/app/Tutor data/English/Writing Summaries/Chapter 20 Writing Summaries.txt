\part{Summary Writing Process}

A summary is a restatement of someone else’s words in your own words. There are many different kinds of summaries, and they vary according to the degree to which you interpret or analyze the source. Some are pages long, while others are just one or two sentences. However, for all types of summary, the writer is responsible for generally stating, in his or her own words, the main information or argument of another writer.

\textbf{Purposes of the Summary}

Summaries benefit the reader because they offer a concise, general version of the original information. For a busy reader, summaries provide quick overviews of material. Summaries also show readers that you have understood the general point of a text, and in this way, teachers can test your knowledge. The process of summarizing someone else’s material enables you to understand that material better.

\textbf{What and When to Summarize}

Many student writers tend to quote when they should summarize material. Quote only when the author expresses a point in a particularly telling or interesting language. Otherwise, simply summarize. Use a summary to restate an entire argument. Use a summary to present information.

\textbf{How to Summarize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Read the original passage or text very carefully.
    \item Use a pencil to highlight or underline what you take to be the main point/points of the original text, or make notes in the margins or on another sheet of paper.
    \item If you’re summarizing an entire essay, outline the writer’s arguments.
    \item These notes and outlines should be brief. Using this list of points, you write down the summary, referring to the original text only when you want to make sure of some point. This will help you to reproduce the substance of the passage in your own words.
\end{itemize}

\part{Summary Conventions and Examples}

\textbf{Summary Conventions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Summaries can range in length from two sentences to several pages. What you have to remember is that when you write a summary of something you have read, you make your summary shorter than the original. Usually a summary is one third of the original in length, i.e. if a passage is of 150 words, the summary of it would be about 50 words long.
    \item In any case, use complete sentences to present the main points or information the text you are describing an author’s general points to the reader. Don’t quote extensively. If you quote, use quotation marks and document the quotation. If you fail to document the quotation, even one word that the author used, you are plagiarizing material (presenting another person’s information as if it were your own).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example Summary}

The following is a well-known fable by Aesop. After the fable, a typical summary of it is given.

\textbf{The Lion and the Mouse}

A lion was sleeping in his den one day, when a mischievous mouse for no reason at all ran across the outstretched paw and up the royal nose of the king of beasts, awakening him from his nap. The mighty beast clapped his paw upon the now thoroughly frightened little creature and would have made an end of him.

“Please,” squealed the mouse, “Don’t kill me. Forgive me this time, O King, and I shall never forget it. A day may come, who knows, when I may do you a good turn to repay your kindness.” The lion smiling at his little prisoner’s fright and amused by the thought that so small a creature ever could be of assistance to the king of beasts, let him go.

Not long afterward the lion, while ranging the forest for his prey, was caught in the net which the hunters had set to catch him. He let out a roar that echoed through the forest. Even the mouse heard it, and recognizing the voice of his former preserver and friend, ran to the spot where he lay tangled in the net of ropes.

“Well, your majesty”, said the mouse, “I know you did not believe me once when I said I would return a kindness, but here is my chance.” And without further ado he set to work to nibble with his sharp little teeth at the ropes that bound the lion. Soon the lion was able to crawl out of the hunter’s snare and be free.

(254 words)

Now read the summary:

Once, a playful mouse ran across the paw and up the nose of a sleeping lion. The lion awoke, caught the mouse, and was about to kill him when the mouse begged forgiveness, saying he might one day return the kindness. Amused, the lion released him. Soon afterward, the lion was caught in a net set by hunters. The mouse heard the lion’s roar, recognized his friend’s voice, and came to help. His sharp teeth cut the ropes, setting the lion free.

(82 words)

\textbf{Note:} The writer of a summary must be able to tell the difference between a main idea and a minor idea. In the above fable, the idea that the lion was caught in a net is essential to the story, and is therefore, a main idea. But it is not necessary or essential to know that when the lion was caught, or that he had been ranging the forest for his prey.

Here is a one sentence summary of the fable:

A mouse, whose life had once been spared by a lion, later returned the kindness by freeing the lion from a hunter’s net.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.

There are many different reasons for reading. Sometimes we read for pleasure, i.e., just to be entertained. Sometimes we read for information, or for direction or instruction. Often we read to find out about the people around us and the world we live in.

We read different kinds of material in different ways. We don’t always read everything at the same speed. With certain kinds of material we need to read slowly and carefully, for example, when we are trying to understand difficult ideas in a text like science or economics books. We also read directions and instructions slowly and carefully. We usually read stories, magazines, newspapers, where the material is usually written in an easily understandable way, at a normal speed, neither too slow nor too fast. Whereas, when we read something we have read before, or we know about, we usually read very rapidly. A good reader suits his or her speed to what he or she reads.

Skimming and scanning are additional ways of helping us read more efficiently. They save time. When we want to get the overall idea or the gist of a text, we do not need to read every word in it. We can skim or look over the text quickly, often read the first paragraph, then the first and last sentences of the other paragraphs quickly. The final paragraph often summarizes the content. This kind of reading is called skimming. On the other hand, when we want to find specific information in a text, we scan the text searching for words or phrases that would give us the information we need. This is called scanning.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Activity 2}

Following is an extract from a story by Isaac Asimov, the great master of science-fiction writers. Read the passage and then answer the questions that follow.

‘Tony is a robot. His actual designation on the company files is TN-3, but he will answer to Tony. He is not a mechanical monster, nor simply a calculating machine of the type that were developed during World War II, fifty years ago. He has an artificial brain nearly as complicated as our own. It is an immense telephone switchboard on an atomic scale, so that billions of possible “telephone connections” can be compressed into an instrument that will fit inside a skull.

‘Such brains are manufactured for each model of robot specifically. Each contains a pre-calculated set of connections so that each robot knows the English language to start with and enough of anything else that may be necessary to perform his job.

‘Until now, US Robots has confined its manufacturing activity to industrial models for use in places where human labour is impractical—in deep mines, for instance or in underwater work. But we want to invade the city and the home. To do so, we must get the ordinary man and woman to accept these robots without fear. You understand that there is nothing to fear.’

‘He can’t get angry with you, my dear. I told you that the switchboard connections of his brain were pre-determined. The most important connection of all is what we call “The First Law of Robotics” and it is merely this: “No robot can harm a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.” All robots are built so. No robot can be forced in any way to do harm to any human.’

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Choose the best answer from the alternatives given below.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item i) TN-3
        \begin{itemize}
            \item a) is a monster.
            \item b) works in deep mines.
            \item c) has a complicated brain.
            \item d) is an industrial model.
        \end{itemize}
        \item ii) The robot’s brain works like
        \begin{itemize}
            \item a) an old calculating machine.
            \item b) a telephone.
            \item c) a mechanical toy.
            \item d) a switchboard with billions of connections.
        \end{itemize}
        \item iii) No one should be afraid of a robot because
        \begin{itemize}
            \item a) it works under water.
            \item b) it is just a calculating machine.
            \item c) it has a complicated brain.
            \item d) it can’t be forced to harm a human being.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Activity 3}

Fill in each of the blanks in the following summary of the passage with a suitable word.

A robot knows a language and enough of anything else to \_\_ (a) his job. TN-3 is the actual \_\_ (b) given to \_\_ (c) by the company. Tony has an \_\_ (d) brain which is \_\_ (e) ours. The robot manufacturers are now trying to bring robots to cities and \_\_ (f). That’s why they are trying hard to make people \_\_ (g) that there is no reason to \_\_ (h) a robot.

\textbf{Activity 4}

Read the following selection. On your paper, write down the key words. Then summarise the main ideas of the paragraph in a few sentences.

On farms and in small towns a hundred and fifty years ago, family members learned to depend on each other for recreation and fun. There were no radios, television sets, movie houses, sports stadiums, museums, so forth. Parents and children had to invent their own pleasures. In the evenings after the work was done, some members of the family read aloud to others. May be they played games, or sometimes the whole family sang together. Modern families do few things together as a group. Parents often go out together as a couple, apart from their children. Each child has his or her friends. Some families have more than one television set so that all the members do not even watch television together. Instead of families making their own fun together, individual members tend to go to recreational facilities for entertainment.

\textbf{Activity 5}

Read the following poem. Write a summary of the poem in 4 to 5 sentences.

\textbf{Strange Dreams Come True}

In years gone by\\
Men thought and dreamed\\
Of things that could not be—\\
Like the traveling\\
Up in the sky,\\
Or, deep down in the sea;\\
Or, watching things\\
That eyes can’t see—\\
Too little—or too far—\\
Or hearing distant\\
Voice or sound,\\
No matter where you are.\\
But now we have\\
The radio,\\
And subs and cars and jets,\\
And phones and trains,\\
And microscopes\\
And television sets.\\
So many things\\
Have seemed absurd,\\
But in men’s minds they grew—\\
The dreams which were\\
Impossible\\
Have in the end come true!
