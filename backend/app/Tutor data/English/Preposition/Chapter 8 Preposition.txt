\part{Simple Prepositions}

\textbf{A.} Read the following passage and notice the underlined words:

Being a student of class nine, I am now reading \underline{\textbf{in}} a high school. I admitted myself \underline{\textbf{into}} this school \underline{\textbf{after}} completing my primary education \underline{\textbf{from}} a village school. I was not given any choice. It was my parents who decided \underline{\textbf{on}} this school. However, I love my school very much. I have made friends \underline{\textbf{with}} many students of my class.

These words are called prepositions. A preposition is a word or group of words which usually comes before a noun (or anything equivalent to a noun) and shows its relationship with another word in the sentence. The prepositions in the above passage are all single words. A single-word preposition is called a \textit{simple preposition}.

\textbf{B.} Look at the following simple prepositions and see how some of them are used in sentences:

\begin{tabular}{llll}
about & below & from & since \\
above & beneath & in & than \\
across & beside & inside & through \\
after & besides & near & till \\
against & between & of & to \\
along & beyond & off & toward/towards \\
among & by & on & under \\
around & despite & into & up \\
as & down & outside & upon \\
at & during & over & with \\
before & except & past & within \\
behind & for & round & without \\
\end{tabular}

Choose any ten prepositions (not the ones you saw in the passage above) from the list and make sentences with them.

Complete the following sentences with prepositions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a. I know nothing \_\_ the matter.
    \item b. I shall see you \_\_ this class.
    \item c. They fought \_\_ each other.
    \item d. He called me \_\_ 9 o’clock.
    \item e. We started \_\_ Dhaka \_\_ sunrise.
    \item f. She sat \_\_ me \_\_ the bus.
    \item g. They have a good relationship \_\_ them.
    \item h. Such a thing was \_\_ my imagination.
    \item i. Everybody was present there \_\_ Karim.
    \item j. Natore is not very far \_\_ here.
    \item k. They were sitting \_\_ the room.
    \item l. We were waiting \_\_ the room.
    \item m. The plane was flying \_\_ the buildings.
    \item n. It is a quarter \_\_ five.
    \item o. There was a cat \_\_ the table.
    \item p. We cannot live \_\_ water.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{C.} Remember that a preposition is usually followed by a noun or pronoun or anything else equivalent to a noun. For example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{With} whom did you go there?
    \item \textbf{In} which box did you keep the money?
\end{itemize}

But in conversational English we say:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Who did you go there \textbf{with}?
    \item Which box did you keep the money \textbf{in}?
\end{itemize}

In these sentences the prepositions have been shifted from their initial position to the end of the sentence.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Complete the following sentences with prepositions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1. Where are you \_\_?
    \item 2. What are they talking \_\_?
    \item 3. Who are you writing this letter \_\_?
    \item 4. Which country is London the capital \_\_?
    \item 5. Who is this seat \_\_?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{D.} A preposition may be preceded by a noun, adjective, or verb. Notice the following examples:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I have no \textbf{sympathy} \textbf{for} her. (noun)
    \item The cat is \textbf{fond} \textbf{of} milk. (adjective)
    \item He \textbf{succeeded} \textbf{in} solving his problem. (verb)
\end{itemize}

A preposition can express the idea of place, time, means, or any other relationship. Even a single preposition can express different relationships. Notice the following examples:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Above}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The stars are \textbf{above} the world.
        \item He is \textbf{above} me in office.
        \item Today’s temperature is \textbf{above} 42\textdegree{} Celsius.
        \item His honesty is \textbf{above} suspicion.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{After}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He came here \textbf{after} breakfast.
        \item They always run \textbf{after} money.
        \item The school is named \textbf{after} its founder’s name.
        \item May comes \textbf{after} April.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Before}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He saw me \textbf{before} lunch.
        \item They stood \textbf{before} the headmaster.
        \item April comes \textbf{before} May.
        \item The drama was staged \textbf{before} a large audience.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Here is a gift \textbf{for} you.
        \item We started \textbf{for} Dhaka.
        \item It has been raining \textbf{for} two hours.
        \item I bought this bag \textbf{for} two hundred taka.
        \item He works \textbf{for} a bank.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{From}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Where do you come \textbf{from}?
        \item The train started \textbf{from} Rajshahi at 7 o’clock.
        \item Natore is 30 miles \textbf{from} Rajshahi.
        \item He is suffering \textbf{from} fever.
        \item Soap is made \textbf{from} coconut oil.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{With}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He went there \textbf{with} his father.
        \item I like bread \textbf{with} butter.
        \item She cut the mango \textbf{with} a knife.
        \item She quarreled \textbf{with} her mother.
        \item He was trembling \textbf{with} fear.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

You can try and use some other simple prepositions to express more than one relationship.

\part{Complex Prepositions}

\textbf{A.} Read the following passage and notice the underlined words:

I went to Dhaka last week \underline{\textbf{with a view to}} attending a seminar. Actually our chairman was supposed to go there. But he could not go \underline{\textbf{because of}} his illness. So I had to make a speech there \underline{\textbf{on behalf of}} the chairman. I said everything \underline{\textbf{in accordance with}} his suggestion. It was my first speech \underline{\textbf{in front of}} a large audience.

These are \textit{complex prepositions}. Like a simple preposition, a complex preposition also comes before a noun and shows its relationship with another word in the sentence. It is called complex because it consists of more than one word. It can also be called a \textit{phrasal preposition}.

\textbf{B.} Here is a list of some other complex/phrasal prepositions:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
according to & in the event of \\
along with & in view of \\
by means of & with reference to \\
by virtue of & in addition to \\
in the light of & in lieu of \\
owing to & instead of \\
for the sake of & in course of \\
in favour of & together with \\
in spite of & with an eye to \\
in search of & with respect to \\
\end{tabular}

\textbf{Activity 1}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1. He could not go there \_\_ his illness.
    \item 2. The crow flew here and there \_\_ water.
    \item 3. \_\_ her illness, she came to class yesterday.
    \item 4. Please cast your vote \_\_ our candidate.
