\part{Characteristics and Structure of Paragraphs}

You have done a good deal of work on paragraph writing up to Class 8. Now reflect on your previous experience and note down what you understand about the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is a paragraph?
    \item What are the characteristics of a paragraph?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the following text and then answer the questions that follow.

In the dinosaur age the earth was infested by dinosaurs of different shapes and sizes. Some dinosaurs were very huge; they were heavier than dozen elephants. Some dinosaurs walked on powerful hind legs and stood as tall as palm trees. Still others had short legs, square bodies and were as big as army tanks. These dinosaurs had long horns and ugly, hooked beaks. Dinosaurs were so strange and terrible that other animals ran away from them in fright. The dinosaur age ended with the extinction of dinosaurs.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a. What is the main idea of the passage?
    \item b. Which sentence states the main or the topic idea?
    \item c. Are the other sentences related to the main idea? Does the passage give an impression of unity or oneness?
\end{itemize}

The passage is an example of a paragraph.

Now read the passage below and note down the points made about a paragraph and its characteristics.

A paragraph is a unit of written discourse (may be spoken discourse also). It may be self contained i.e. complete in itself, or may be used as part of a longer discourse such as an essay or other assignments. The main idea of a well-written paragraph is usually expressed in one sentence. This is called the topic sentence. Then the idea is developed sentence by sentence. It is usually made up of a number of logically connected sentences written on one single topic. Each sentence of a paragraph should be closely related to the topic, and the paragraph should have a good structure with a beginning, middle and end.

An effective paragraph, according to Donald et al (1978) should have 3 major characteristics which are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It develops one idea only, called the controlling idea or thesis statement.
    \item It should have sufficient details to support the controlling idea.
    \item It should have a beginning, a middle, and an end, that is, it requires a topic sentence, a body to develop the topic sentence and a conclusion.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The beginning or topic sentence introduces the topic or subject of the paragraph.
    \item The middle or body develops and provides support to the topic or thesis statement.
    \item The conclusion or end sums up and reaches a conclusion about the topic/subject.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 2}

Discuss in pairs or groups what the above text says about paragraph and its characteristics.

\textbf{Activity 3}

Read the following texts and see which one is a paragraph and which one is not. Explain why you think so.

\textbf{Text A}

Besides care for personal appearance, he should pay close attention to his manner of talking and finally, an applicant must show self confidence. For a successful interview, an applicant should demonstrate some qualities. The applicant should be elegantly, not too casually or too gorgeously, dressed. Firstly he should be knowledgeable; a good degree also is necessary. Good preparation for interview is also needed. Job interview is important for everyone.

\textbf{Text B}

Paragraphs can be classified in various ways. In essays paragraphs are classified into introductory, development, transitional, summarizing etc, types. Depending on the purpose of the writer, on the other hand, paragraphs may be classified into persuasive, argumentative, descriptive, narrative etc, types. According to techniques of development they can be classified into cause and effect, contrast, comparison, definition etc. types. In short, these are the major classifications of paragraphs.

\textbf{Activity 4}

The following sentences are not in proper order to form a coherent paragraph. Rearrange them in a logical order. Put a number in the bracket against each sentence according to the sequence you would like to arrange them in.

\begin{itemize}
    \item ( ) Last Friday was a frustrating day.
    \item ( ) But my father called me and asked me to type a few official letters for him before I went.
    \item ( ) It was my aunt from next door calling to check if I could give her some time.
    \item ( ) It was a beautiful, warm and sunny day. I decided to go out and enjoy the lovely weather.
    \item ( ) When I finished typing, I got up quickly and hurried towards the door.
    \item ( ) I got dressed, took my fishing rod, and got my bicycle out to go fishing.
    \item ( ) When I got back home, the sun had already set. I was still dressed to go fishing, and the cycle and the fishing rod were there leaning against the gate.
    \item ( ) Just at that moment, the door bell rang.
    \item ( ) She needed me to take her to the hospital.
    \item ( ) Her daughter, my cousin, has just given birth to a baby boy.
    \item ( ) As I took the cycle and the fishing rod inside the house I realized that I had spent the day doing things I never thought I’d do.
    \item ( ) I left the fishing rod and the cycle standing against a wall in the courtyard, ready to go the moment I would finish typing the letters.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 5}

Look at the sentences below. They do not fit into one paragraph. They refer to two different topics. Separate the sentences for two different paragraphs and rearrange them into two logically connected paragraphs.

\begin{itemize}
    \item My first day in the new school was difficult.
    \item There were some benches and an outdoor oven in the picnic area.
    \item In the National Park of Shalna we found perfect setting for our picnic.
    \item I got stuck in the traffic jam and reached school fifteen minutes late.
    \item Everyone had gone to class and I found no one to ask for direction.
    \item Nearby we found a football field, and not further away, a big pond where some of my friends went swimming immediately.
    \item Twice I was embarrassed when I walked into classroom that was not mine.
    \item Behind the picnic area was a forest where some of us went for a walk after lunch.
    \item The building was so huge that it was hard to find my classroom.
    \item Finally, I decided to go into my classroom
    \item When I ultimately got to my class, I was almost in tears.
    \item We liked the place so much that as we rode home on bus, we agreed to have next year’s picnic in the same spot
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Types of Paragraphs}

There are many types of paragraphs. The major types are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Descriptive paragraph
    \item Narrative paragraph
    \item Cause and Effect paragraph
    \item Comparison paragraph
    \item Contrast paragraph
    \item Expository paragraph
    \item Argumentative paragraph
    \item Persuasive paragraph
    \item Listing paragraph
\end{itemize}

Some of these types are dealt with elaborately from lesson 3 onward.

\textbf{Writing an effective topic sentence}

A good topic sentence introduces the topic to be developed in a paragraph. It controls or limits the focus of paragraph, and once the focus is mentioned, there is no scope to go outside it. Anything outside its scope will be redundant or unnecessary. On the other hand, if the paragraph does not sufficiently support the topic statement that proves another weakness of a paragraph.

Remember that although the topic sentence usually comes at the beginning of a paragraph, it may sometimes come at the end or even in the middle of the paragraph. Sometimes the main idea of a paragraph can be so obvious that it need not be stated explicitly.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the following paragraph from a thank-you note and then answer the questions that follow.

You have made everybody in our family happy by giving me the raincoat. Sonia is happy because she won’t have to lend me her raincoat again. Mother is happy because we have stopped arguing over who is going to use the one raincoat we have had. Father is happy because he doesn’t have to buy one now. Even old grandpa is happy because now the house is quiet and he can sleep peacefully. I am the happiest person of all because you gave me a wonderful gift.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a. What is the topic sentence of the above paragraph?
    \item b. What is the topic?
    \item c. How do all the other sentences add up to explain the main idea of the topic sentence?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 2}

In each of the following paragraphs, the topic sentence is missing. Supply the topic sentence for each.

\textbf{a. Tourist Spots in Bangladesh}

The first and most important tourist attraction in the country is Cox’s Bazar sea beach, which is the longest sea beach in the world that has a sloping sandy beach where people can go swimming and have sun baths. One can also go for drive long the beach. The hilly area beside the beach has a wonderful natural beauty. The scene of sun-rising and sunset seen from the beach have unique beauties of their own that can only be felt, and difficult to express in language. The second attraction for tourists in Bangladesh is the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest of the world. The dense and tall tropical forest is remarkable for its natural beauty. The streams running through the forest, and its habitats, the Royal Bengal tigers, striped deer and other animals make it one of the world heritage sites of the world. Kuakata beach of Barishal and Patenga beach of Chattogram are some other places of natural beauty worth visiting in Bangladesh. The country has many other scenes and sights worth visiting for local and foreign tourists.

\textbf{b. Developments in Rural Transport System}

A revolution has taken place in the rural transport sector in Bangladesh. About a decade or so ago, there were hardly any mechanized mode of transport in the rural areas; people had to walk long distances. Students used to walk three four miles to go to school and another three four miles of walking back home from school. Farmers used to carry their goods either on their heads or by bullock or buffalo driven carts. But with the improvement of roads in the rural areas, non-conventional mechanized transports are seen frequently moving along the roads, carrying both people and goods. This mechanized transport system that includes engine driven vans, tempos, auto-rickshaw and the like have changed the face of rural Bangladesh. The farmers can easily market their products by using these transports. It has brought mobility in rural life and it is largely contributing to the economic growth of Bangladesh. Thus it is noticed that very significant change has taken place in the rural transport system of Bangladesh.

\textbf{Activity 3}

Use the topics below and compose a topic sentence for each one. The topics are too broad for developing into single paragraphs. Think of an idea about each topic and then state the idea in a topic sentence.

For example, A Good Friend might have the topic sentence “One quality I look for in a friend is loyalty.”

\begin{itemize}
    \item a. A good friend
    \item b. The value of my hobby
    \item c. How I spend my weekend
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity 4}

Complete the plan for a paragraph shown below. Add more supporting details. Then write the paragraph thanking the host of the party mentioned in the outline below:

\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Main Idea and Point of View} & \textbf{Topic Sentence} & \textbf{Supporting Details} \\
\hline
Writer enjoyed a party to show appreciation for being invited & I just wanted you to know how much I enjoyed your party. & 1. The raffle draw was so much fun. \\
& & 2. The food........ \\
& & 3. And I was so glad to..... meet \\
& & 4. ........ \\
& & 5 .......... \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\part{Descriptive Paragraphs}

Description is that kind of writing that pictures a place, a person, or an object. In learning to write description, you should sharpen your powers of observation i.e. train your five senses—sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste. Try to picture for your reader the people, places or objects you are familiar with and have observed carefully. This will help you describe them vividly by using details that would appeal to your reader.

When you write a descriptive paragraph, tell who or what you are describing in your topic sentence. Here is an example for you. Read the paragraph below and look for details that appeal to the senses.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow:

The rainstorm was becoming more intense. Outside the wind roared and raindrops splashed against the window panes. The wind rattled the windows and slammed the shutters against the front of the house. Water began to drip from the living-room ceiling in big noisy splashes. Then a loud burst of thunder vibrated the house and made everybody jump. Five year old Rima hid her face in her mother’s lap and began to cry.

Which details in the paragraph above help you hear sounds? Which help you see the rain?

\textbf{Activity 2}

A good paragraph helps the reader see something exactly as the writer sees it. Think of details of your own to describe the following things. Try to use your five senses: sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a. The clouds in Autumn, or in the rainy season
    \item b. The star fruit
    \item c. Your favourite flower, or your favourite food
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Describing People}

\textbf{A.} Read the following extract taken from Ernest Hemingway’s story, \textit{The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber}:

Francis Macomber was very tall, very well built if you did not mind that length of bone, dark, his hair cropped like an oarsman, rather thin-lipped, and was considered handsome. He was dressed in the same sort of safari clothes that Wilson wore except that his were new. He was thirty-five years old, kept himself very fit.

Notice that the details in the above passage describe the physical features and appearance of Francis Macomber.

\textbf{B.} Now read the paragraph below from another story, \textit{The Capital of the World}, by the same author and see how it describes both the appearance and some of the nature of the person being described:

He was a well built boy with very black, rather curly hair, good teeth and a skin that his sisters envied, and he had a ready and unpuzzled smile. He was fast on his feet and did his work well and loved his sisters, who seemed beautiful and sophisticated; and he loved his work.

\textbf{C.} Read the following paragraph and notice how the topic sentence expresses the main idea of the topic, i.e. my little sister acts like my big sister. And then notice how this is developed through illustrations or examples in the following sentences:

My little sister might as well be called my big sister. I’m twenty years old, and Urmila is only twelve. But Urmila acts like a sixty year old lady, not only with me but with everyone else in the house. She is regularly advising my father on what to wear, what to eat, when to take rest. My mother merely smiles when Urmila advises her on what to cook for the day or if the curry was a little too salty. Maybe we all pamper her a little and accept her adult acting. But last month when I came down with the flu, I realized how precious she was to me. She sat beside me all the time, putting an ice-bag on my forehead, bringing me water and fruit juice to drink and often, in her usual manner, scolding me if I did not take medicine on time. And all through those days she tried to cheer me up by telling me the “little stories” of her life. That one time she really was my “big” sister.

\textbf{Activity 3}

Write a paragraph on a brother or sister (or any close relation) of yours. Write a topic sentence telling the reader about a characteristic thing of his or her nature. Then write sentences to develop that idea.

\textbf{Activity 4}

Write a paragraph describing your best friend. You can describe some features of his/her appearance as well as some aspects of his/her nature, or can describe just one of the two.

\textbf{Describing a Place}

\textbf{D.} Read the following paragraph in which the writer is describing a street in the early morning as he or she sees it.

\textbf{A Street in Early Morning}

In the early morning streets are scenes of serene beauty. I live on the eighth floor of a high-rise building by a very busy street in Dhaka city. But in the early morning the street wears a very different look. When I get up early, I often stand on the balcony overlooking the street. The sun has just come up and its light bathes the whole street with a golden glow. The street lights, after the night’s vigilance, say goodbye as they are turned off. On the footpath the street dogs that were awake all night curl up for a bit of sleep. On the other side of the street, a few unfortunate homeless people pull up their torn bed sheets to shade them from the sun and go back to sleep again. A car, with its headlights still on, rolls by slowly as if sorry to disturb the morning calm. A few rickshaw pullers paddle their vehicles slowly towards no particular destination. A tea stall lights its fire and the smoke from it fills the quiet morning with heavenly mists. A light breeze brushes my face as I stand there enjoying the serene beauty, trying not to think of the noise and hustle of the day that will surely follow in a few short minutes.

\textbf{Activity 5}

Write a paragraph describing a busy city street.

\textbf{E.} Here is another descriptive paragraph. Read the paragraph and find out the topic sentence, developers and terminator or concluding sentence in it.

\textbf{a) Rural Life in Bangladesh}

The majority of the people of Bangladesh live in the rural areas. People live a very plain and simple life. Majority of the rural people are farmers. They work on their lands and earn their livelihood by cultivating their own land or working on other people’s land. They work hard from morning till night. Some of the farmers are quite well-to-do, but there are many landless people also. The affluent people of the rural community send their children to schools, colleges and universities, but the poorer section cannot afford their children’s education. In most cases, their children become child labourers. They work as day labourers in other people’s houses or turn rickshaw or van drivers. These days, most of them can, however, earn enough to manage two square meals a day. Some of them go to the nearby towns and cities to work as rickshaw pullers, garments workers, taxi or auto-rickshaw drivers. Whatever is the amount of money they earn, they are happy with what they have. These days the rural people have modern facilities of life too. Most houses have electricity, television; the rich people also have refrigerators, improved sanitation system. In every nook and corner of the villages, there are small bazaars, where people go for shopping and spend their leisure time taking tea, gossiping, watching movies, sports etc. together. Most villages have primary schools, there are high schools and colleges in every two/three villages. The rate of education in the rural areas is increasing rapidly. Rural people have a good community life. They help each other in their weal and woe. The villages have been modernized over the last two/three decades.

\textbf{Activity 6}

Write a paragraph describing a reading room in a library.

\textbf{Further Tasks}

Think about the following topics, note down as many points as you can think of. Arrange the points in a logical sequence, write a topic sentence, and then develop a paragraph on each topic.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a. A historic place/site
    \item b. The Parliament House (Sangsad Bhaban)/The National Mausoleum
    \item c. An old house
    \item d. A summer evening
    \item e. A crowded market
    \item f. A double decker bus
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Describing an event:}

\textbf{Activity 7}

Look at the picture below and describe what is happening.

\part{Narrative Paragraphs}

The purpose of narration is story telling. Narrative paragraphs narrate or tell about some past incidents or events. The simplest kind of story is the kind of writing that tells us about a series of actions, usually in time order, in a single paragraph. A good narrative paragraph often tells us not only ‘what happened’ but also ‘how it happened’. While writing a narrative paragraph you should keep in mind the following guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a. present the subject in a topic sentence
    \item b. include information about the people and the setting
    \item c. tell the action in chronological order
    \item d. use transitional words, such as, first, soon, next, then, later, etc.
    \item e. write a concluding sentence to bring the incident to a definite end
\end{itemize}

Here are some examples of narrative paragraphs.

\textbf{A Horrible Childhood Memory}

Some of the past memories are not forgettable. Here I narrate one such memory of my life. I remember a fateful day when my friend, Sameer, almost got drowned. During our summer holidays, our school was closed. There was a big pond close to our home. My friends and I often went there to take our bath and have a swim. On that bright colourless summer day I had gone with my two friends, Sameer and Arif, to the pond. We got into water, swam for a while and were thoroughly enjoying ourselves. At one stage, when we were quite far away from the bank I heard Sameer cry out for help. He was going under water. At first I thought he was making fun, but soon I realized that there was something wrong. I saw Arif swimming toward Sameer. But Sameer was drowning, his body was under water. We could not find him. It was a serious situation; everybody was tensed. I was puzzled and could not decide what to do. Then I swam towards the bank and cried out to the passerby to do something to rescue Sameer. Hearing my shouts a young man rushed to the spot, took off his shirt and jumped into the pond within moments. He dived into the water, searched for Sameer a few times, and after about five minutes found him and brought him on the surface, and carried him to the bank in an unconscious state. We were still not sure about his condition. Then he shook Sameer in a special way for sometimes. After about 40 minutes Sameer had some movement and opened his eyes. It was a terrible experience of my life.

\textbf{My First Day at School}

I still remember my first day at school. A few months before I was taken to school, there was a kind of preparation in the family for helping me start a new chapter of my life, my school life. A new dress was tailored, a new bag and a few new books were purchased. On a fine morning in January, my grandmother and my mother dressed me up for school, hanged my school bag with the books inside at my back, and my grandfather, who was excessively fond of me, held me by my hand and led me to school. It was primary school about half a mile away from our home, not very far, but I had never been there before. From a distance I could hear the noise of the students learning their lessons in a loud voice, and there was a sound like the singing of a chorus. When I reached the school, I saw a large number of boys and girls sitting in five different clusters, each cluster was a class. I could see them all, as there was no partition to separate the classes. I was afraid to see so many boys and girls, and the noise they were making. Moreover, the teachers were quite old and seemed rather unfriendly to me. My grandfather took me to the Head Teacher for admission, completed some formalities, gave me some advice and left me in the school. But five minutes after my grandfather had left, I felt so helpless among these strangers that I decided not to continue. Within moments, I took my bag and started running after my grandfather. I managed to overtake him in a few minutes, but he was surprised to see me thus run away from school. He tried to take me back to the school, but I started crying piteously. This moved my grandfather, who carried me back home. When I think of this now, it provokes laughter.

See how the above paragraphs begin, develop and end.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Write a narrative paragraph about an unforgettable experience in your life. You may use the following questions to help you generate ideas.

What? Where? When? How? Why? etc.

\textbf{Activity 2}

Write a narrative paragraph on any one of the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a) A birthday party you attended
    \item b) Celebration of Pohela Baishakh in your school last year
    \item c) A picnic/ outing that you enjoyed very much
    \item d) A sad experience of your life
\end{itemize}

\part{Cause/Effect and Comparison/Contrast Paragraphs}

This type of paragraph begins with a statement of the effect first, and then goes on to give the causes that contribute to that effect.

\textbf{A.} Read the paragraphs below and see how they begin, and what follows in the body and conclusion in each of them. Also find what is the effect and what are the causes in each paragraph?

\textbf{1. Causes of Road Accidents in Bangladesh}

Road accident is a regular phenomenon in Bangladesh. Many people die of road accidents every year; many others become permanently disabled, so it is considered a curse. Road accidents occur for various reasons. Many factors are responsible for road accidents. The most common cause is drivers without driving license. Many of the drivers in Bangladesh do not have driving license. Even if there is a driver with license, sometimes the conductors drive and the licensed driver take rest. Secondly, some of the drivers drive very recklessly and they try to overtake, which in most cases are one of the major causes of road accidents. Thirdly, many of the drivers overwork. They drive by day, and sometimes they drive night coach also on the same day, which cause much fatigue and the drivers feel sleepy which may cause serious accidents. Fourthly, mechanical troubles such as break failure, also cause accidents. The drivers, in many cases, do not properly check the engines before they start driving. Fifthly, there are too many buses on the roads. Moreover the roads are two-lane roads without any dividers. So, sometimes there are head-on collisions and sometimes the buses skid off the roads. There are other reasons also, but these are some of the major reasons of road accidents in Bangladesh.

\textbf{2. Causes of Students’ Failure in Examination}

Many students fail in different public examinations every year. There are many causes of students’ failure. The main cause is lack of students’ interest in some subjects. Students do not enjoy learning and the system cannot make learning interesting. The major motivation is to pass and get a good grade, but beyond that, they do not seem interested in learning things for their relevance in life. Students’ motivation to learning is very poor. Another important reason for students’ failure is that the content students are required to deal with does not seem to have any relevance for their practical and professional life. Third important reason for failure of students is that they study seasonally before the exams and neglect their studies throughout the year. Moreover, teachers in the country are not skilled enough to motivate the students and make their learning an interesting experience. Besides, a need-based curriculum, as well as meaningful and interesting textbooks for learners would improve the situation significantly. However, without skilled teachers nothing would take place as we desire.

\textbf{3. Causes of the Spread of English as a Global Language}

English has emerged as the major international language of the world. The importance of English has increased many times in the present world. There are many reasons for this. Firstly, interdependence of nations in the world has also increased after World War II, for trade and commerce and for many other purposes. Secondly, people are moving from one country to another for education, tourism, diplomatic and other reasons. A common language is required for interaction among people from different countries and contexts, who speak different languages. Without a common language it is difficult to perform different activities at the international level. English has assumed the position of that common language. Thirdly, it has also become the major library language of the world, as most of the library books in the world are in English. Education of international standard is not possible without good command of English as most of the books and journals in libraries all over the world are in English. Fourthly, English is also the language of technology. It is difficult to live in the present world without computers, internet, facebook, twitter etc, which are used globally by people across borders and English is the dominant language for those. These are some of the major causes of the emergence of English as a global/international language.

Notice that each of the above paragraphs begins with a statement of the effect as topic sentence and then in the body of the paragraphs, the causes are given.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Write a cause and effect paragraph on each topic below following the above models of development.

\begin{itemize}
    \item a) Causes of environmental pollution
    \item b) Causes of poverty in Bangladesh
    \item c) Causes of moral degradation among the young generation of today
\end{itemize}

Listing paragraph provides a list of items in support of the topic sentence. The following paragraph provides a list of the major fruits of Bangladesh.

\textbf{Fruits of Bangladesh}

In Bangladesh, many kinds of fruits are available, and the fruit market in the country also is expanding. Firstly, the name that comes to our mind is mango which is the most popular and tasty fruit grown in plenty in different districts of the country. Another very popular and tasty fruit is the leeches which also grows abundantly in some northern districts of Bangladesh. The third popular fruit is the jack fruit which is also our national fruit. Fourthly we can mention bananas which too is very delicious and nutritious that grows in plenty in most of the districts in Bangladesh. Fifthly, the name of guava, which is very rich in vitamin C is available round the year. Among other fruits, we can mention orange, pineapple, apple which used to be imported in our country, but now growing in some regions of our country. Now Fruits60are available in all the seasons, but some fruits are available in some specific seasons. Foreign fruits such as apple, orange and the like are also grown in Bangladesh now and they are available round the year. People in the country are becoming increasingly fond of fruits, so growing fruits has also become lucrative for the growers also.

\textbf{Activity 1}

Notice how the paragraph begins and develops. Find out the topic sentence, and terminators, comment on their effectiveness. Are they well developed?

Here are more examples of listing paragraphs. Notice their structure (beginning, middle and end). Comment on their effectiveness.

\textbf{Stages of Bangladesh Education System}

Education system of Bangladesh has few distinct stages. The first stage is the pre-primary stage which comprises the two years of nursery school education. The second step, which is the first official step in the country, is the primary level that comprises classes I to 5 and now ends with Primary Education Completion (PEC) Examination. The next step is the Junior School level which comprises three years of education from Class 6 to class 8 and ends with Junior School Certificate (JSC) Examination. The fourth step, officially third step according to the new Education Policy 2010, is secondary education that includes two years from class IX to class X and ends with Secondary School Certificate (S.S.C). The fifth step is the Higher Secondary level education for two years and includes classes XI and XII and ends with Higher Secondary Certificate (H.S.C) Examination. The next step is Higher education that comprises 4 years of Bachelor’s (Honours) degree and one year Master’s degree, or 3 years of Bachelor’s (pass) degree followed by two years’ Master’s degree. After these levels, there are also research programs for M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees. These are the different stages of the education system in Bangladesh.

\textbf{Literary Genres/Forms}

There are a number of major literary genres marked by their distinctive characteristics. First, Poetry is a major genre of literature marked by connotative, suggestive or ornamental use of language, rhyme, and rhythm. This makes poetry different from other genres of literature. Poetry again has sub-genres like lyric, sonnet, elegy, epic etc. Another major genre of literature is drama or play which is written both in prose and verse. Drama is primarily a performing art, not a narrative art, and is meant to be staged in a theatre. It is composed in dialogue, and is marked by action of the actors and actresses. Drama has subgenres like tragedy, comedy, tragi-comedy and history plays. The third major genre of literature is fiction which is a narrative art, written usually in prose, has one or more narrators telling the story/stories. Fiction has sub-genres like novel and short story. The fourth genre of literature is non-fiction prose. Creative writers in all ages and all countries have tried their hands in all these genres and entertained readers of all ages with their writings.

\textbf{Activity 2}

Write listing paragraphs on the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a) Picnic spots in your district
    \item b) The major sources of entertainment of the time
    \item c) Tiers of local government
\end{itemize}

This type of paragraphs shows similarities between two persons, places, things, objects, actions or ideas. The topic sentence shows how we are comparing the features or qualities of two subjects. To use this technique, we can have two procedures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a) We can compare two subjects’ features or qualities point by point, or
    \item b) We can state all the features or qualities of a subject first and then compare these with those of the other subject.
\end{itemize}

Read the following paragraphs and see how it has been developed. Notice its topic sentence, development and conclusion.

\textbf{A Paragraph and an Essay}

Despite differences in length, a paragraph and an essay have a number of similarities. Firstly, a paragraph has a beginning which is the topic sentence that introduces the topic. Similarly, an essay has a beginning called the introduction which also introduces the key idea(s) of the essay. Secondly, a paragraph has a body comprised of a few sentences called the developers which develop the idea introduced in the topic sentence. Similarly, an essay also has a body comprised of some paragraphs that develop the idea introduced in the introduction of the essay. A paragraph has a terminator or concluding sentence that logically draws the idea of the paragraph to a logical conclusion by restating the idea of the topic sentence. Similarly, in an essay, the concluding paragraph sums up the idea of the essay and concludes with reference to the idea(s) in the introductory paragraph. In addition to these, both have a sense of unity. The different sentences in a paragraph contribute to one idea stated in the topic sentence and thus create a sense of unity; the different paragraphs of an essay, similarly, contribute to the central argument of an essay. Thus a paragraph and an essay are largely similar structurally.

Read one more paragraph of comparison. Comment on its development.

\textbf{A Short Story and a Novel}

Although different in length, a short story and a novel have many similarities. Both belong to the category of literature known as fiction; they are fictitious. Both of them have a story outline or plot. A short story has a setting, both time and space settings; similarly a novel also has time and space settings which contribute to the meaning or theme. Both are narrative arts and have story teller to tell the story. Both are written in prose. Both the genres have some characters, and episodes and both have themes. Thus, a short story and a novel have many similarities.

Contrast paragraphs show the differences between two things.

\textbf{A.} Here is an example of a paragraph which presents a contrast between the stars and the planets.

\textbf{Stars and Planets}

Although stars and planets shine in the night sky, they differ from one another in many ways. In fact, most of the shinning lights in the sky are balls of fire called stars. We do not feel their heat because they are very, very far from us. Our sun is a star. The planets, on the other hand, are balls of cold gas or solid rocks, and revolve round the stars. Our Earth is a planet that goes round the star sun. Mars is another planet that revolves around the sun. Stars come in different sizes and colours. The new stars are bluish-white in colour. Often their heat is so intense that they look white and are called “White Dwarfs”. Then there are large stars that have burnt most of their fuel and are red in colour. They are often so big that astronauts call them “Red Giants”. Like stars, planets also vary in size and colour. Our Earth is a small planet compared to Jupiter, which is a ball of gas, many hundreds of times larger than Earth. The Earth looks blue, the Mars is red, while the Jupiter is orange.

\textbf{B.} Read the following example of a contrast paragraph and see how it begins, develops and ends.

\textbf{Summer and Winter in Bangladesh}

Summer and winter are two contrasting seasons of Bangladesh. Each has its own characteristics that distinguish it from the other. Summer is constituted of the months of May and June; winter, on the other hand, is constituted of the months of December and January, as it really happens these days. Summer is very hot and humid season. Temperature shoots up to 45 degree Celsius sometimes in some places of the country. During the noon time, the roads become empty in the towns and cities as people are afraid to go out in the sun. Sometimes people have heat stroke when they work under the scorching heat of summer. The humidity causes profuse sweating. On the contrary, winter is a very cold season; sometimes mercury goes down to 3 or 4 degree Celsius in some places of the country. Often there is dense fog in winter, and it continues for 3 to 5 days. The sun is not visible for those days. Summer is the season of delicious local fruits like mango, jack fruit and guava among others, whereas, winter is a season of vegetables and flowers of different types. Thus the two seasons of Bangladesh, summer and winter, are marked by distinctive differences.

\textbf{C.} Here are two more examples of contrast paragraph. Read these and notice their organization. See what differences between the two topics in each paragraph are mentioned.

\textbf{A Novel and a Drama}

A novel and a drama are two different genres of literature with distinctly different features. The first is a narrative art that has story and one or more story tellers. It is written in prose. But drama is an action, not a narrative. It is written in dialogue and the characters act out these dialogues on the stage. It is a performing art. A drama is not a drama unless it is acted out on the stage. Drama has an audience, but novel is meant for reading. The narrator introduces and describes the characters in a novel, but in a drama the characters are revealed through the action. Briefly these are some of the major differences between a novel and a drama.

\textbf{Objective Test and Essay Test}

Objective test and essay test are two different types of test which focus on different skills. Both have comparative merits and demerits also. An objective test tries basically to test recognition and recall, some form of it can test basic knowledge and understanding also, but it cannot test analytical and logical thinking of the students and their originality and creativity. Most common types of objective tests are MCQ tests, gap filling, yes/no, true/false type questions etc. Objective tests are easy to score, even machines can score objective tests. So scoring is highly reliable. Marks do not vary among examiners for the same level of answers. Correct answer will get full credits; wrong answers will be given no credit. So whoever the examiner is from wherever, marking is reliable in this type of test. On the other hand, essay tests focus on logical thinking, analytical skill and creativity in presenting an idea, which are very important for all learners for their intellectual development. However, marking is highly subjective in this type of tests. Two examiners may award two different marks for the same type of answers, or even the same examiner may award different marks for the same level of answer if marking at two different times or on two different days. Therefore, scoring of essay tests is not reliable. Thus the two types of tests focus on different aspects, and both have their distinctive merits and demerits and both are needed.
