\part{Informal Letters}

Informal communication takes place in intimate circles, usually among friends and family, and formal communication takes place among people whose relationship is formal. In informal writing and speaking, we use lot of contractions such as \textit{I’m}, \textit{you’re}; \textit{I’ve}, \textit{I’d} etc. Idiomatic expressions or phrasal verbs, exclamation, repetition, tag questions and use of slangs etc, are features of informal writing and speaking. The following letter is an example of an informal letter.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Read the letter and examine the features of informal style in this letter.

    Dear Shuvro,\\
    It’s really, really good to be here in Sylhet. We got here on Saturday evening. The journey was HORRIBLE, the bus moved like a local bus, it stopped quite a few times to pick passengers. It was really irritating. It took twelve hours to get here! But the place we’re staying is very nice the surroundings are beautiful. I’m having a good time with my family now, but I miss you a lot.\\
    It’s now Tuesday afternoon and I’m sitting at a tea-garden chatting with some local boys. The weather is fantastic! It can lift your spirit.\\
    With lots of love,\\

    \item Now rewrite the letter changing some words and expressions to make it sound a little more formal.

    \item Here is another informal letter. Read the following letter and say what aspects of the letter make it informal?

    Hi Stella,\\
    It seems hard to believe that I’ve been here in Sylhet for a whole week now. I promised to write and tell you how I was getting on—so here it goes.\\
    When I first got here, I could not just get used to the new environment with new friends, in new school. Now, though, I’m learning to take things easy and I’m beginning to feel really at home. My first impression of the Sylheti people is that they are really, really friendly and helpful.\\
    I’ve managed to make friends with a few girls. The countryside round the town is marvelous and very green, because it rains a lot here, but too much of rain can really be boring.\\
    Sorry this letter is short, but you know how bad I’m at writing letters. Do write back when you’ve a spare minute. I miss you so much.\\
    All my love,\\
    Sumi

    \item Now convert the letter into a somewhat more formal one.

    \item Further tasks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Write a letter to your younger sister congratulating her on her success in the JSC examination.
        \item Write a letter to your younger brother advising him how to prepare for JSC examination.
        \item Write a letter to a friend inviting him to come and stay with you for a week during the school holidays.
        \item Write a letter to your friend narrating your experience of seeing a new film.
        \item Write a letter to your mother informing her that you had a bad cold, but now you are good after you took some antibiotic prescribed by a physician.
        \item Ask a friend to join your birthday party.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Review:}

All personal letters are informal letters, but the degree of informality varies; some are highly informal, some others are semi formal. The informal letters are characterised as already mentioned above, by:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use of colloquial words
    \item Conversational tone
    \item Use of contractions
    \item Use of two word verbs
    \item Use of slangs (in very intimate circle)
\end{enumerate}

As mentioned earlier, degree of informality varies. For example, when writing to parents, a letter may be a little less informal in its choice of words and tone than a letter written to a very close friend. Contractions and group verbs can be used with parents and other relations who are senior to us and whom we respect, like our uncles and aunts etc. In such personal letters highly emotional words and expressions and slangs should not be used.

\part{Formal Letters}

\textbf{A.} Read the following letter and see how a personal letter is also sometimes formal depending on the relationship. However such letters may have a conversational tone and hence, may be semi-formal.

Look at the following letter written by a son to his father.

\end{flushright}

Dear Father,\\
I could not write to you for the last few days as I was too busy with my annual examination. As you know, our examination is over. Let me tell you that I have done well in all the papers. I hope the results will be good. However, as the new class starts from 7 January, I need to buy some new books. Please send me Tk. 2000.00 extra for the purpose. Also send money for my regular monthly expenditure for the month of January.\\
I hope everybody at home is fine. I phoned mum and Sumi yesterday and learnt about Rita’s birthday party. May the Almighty keep you in good health! Please pray for me.\\
Yours,\\
Shuvro

\textbf{Activity:} How is the style of this letter different from the style of the preceding informal letters?

A formal letter is a letter that you write in formal situations, such as, a student writing to the Head Teacher/Principal of an educational institute for a scholarship or the waiver of the fees; a person writing an application for a job, or someone writing a letter to the editor of a newspaper; or any other kinds of business letter, such as an order or a complaint letter, etc.

In formal letters, no contraction, idioms or phrasal verbs, no colloquial or conversational style or tone is used. An objective, detached style is used in formal writings. Features of informal style mentioned above are not used in formal letters.

\textbf{B.} Read the following letter of complaint.

\begin{flushright}
House 2, Road 2\\
BIHAS, Rajshahi 6205\\
5 December 2015
\end{flushright}

\begin{flushleft}

\end{flushleft}

Subject: A complaint letter regarding customer service

Dear Sir or Madam,\\
I am writing to complain about a leather jacket which I bought from your store 3 weeks ago. I had tried a jacket on in the shop and checked it carefully before I decided to buy it. When I went to the cash desk, however, the assistant persuaded me to take one which was already packaged and assured me that it was perfect.\\
When I reached home and tried the jacket on, I found a large rip under the side pocket. As you will realize, I was extremely upset to discover this. The jacket was very expensive, and I only bought it from you because of your reputation for quality. In fact I always recommended your shop to friends in the past. I was shocked.\\
I am returning the jacket with this letter and looking forward to receiving an apology with a full refund of the cost, Tk. 2950.00.\\
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.\\
Yours sincerely,\\
Moinur Rashid

\textbf{Note:} A formal letter usually has 6 parts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Writer’s address and date on the top right corner
    \item Recipient’s designation and official address on the left side but two paces below the date in number 1.
    \item The salutation Or (addressing)
    \item The body
    \item The subscription (Yours truly)
    \item The signature or name on the bottom right corner. However it can be given on the bottom left corner too.
\end{enumerate}

This format is called a \textit{semi-block style}. The letters above are examples of semi-block style.

\textbf{C.} There is also a \textit{full-block style} in which all the parts are left aligned. Here is a request letter written in the block style:

\begin{flushleft}

Your sending this catalogue by 25 November will be appreciated.\\
Yours sincerely,\\

Notice that the first part of a formal letter usually states the reason for writing. Some useful phrases are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I saw your advertisement in \_\_ and would like to \_\_
    \item I am writing to you about \_\_
    \item With reference to your letter/ advertisement \_\_
    \item Thank you for your letter of \_\_
\end{itemize}

The middle part of a formal letter usually explains the situation in detail.\\
The ending part should normally include some polite remark. Some common remarks include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I look forward to hearing from you soon.
    \item Thanking you,
    \item I would be grateful/thankful if you would \_\_
\end{itemize}

\textbf{D.} Read the following letter of application for free studentship.

\begin{flushleft}

The Head Teacher\\
Pabna Zilla School\\
\\
Subject: Application for full free studentship\\
\\
Dear Sir\\
I have the honour to state that I am a student of class IX in your school. I have been in this school since class three. A notice has been posted on the school notice board inviting application for a special scholarship. I would like to apply for one of the scholarships.\\
In this connection, I would like to inform you that I stood first in all the classes so far. I also regularly take part in school debate and extempore speech competitions, and have won prizes a number of times. My father is a small government employee who manages a large family of six members. Four of us are studying at different levels. It is almost impossible for my father to manage all the family expenses including our educational expenses.\\
I would be very grateful if you kindly grant me one of the scholarships for free studentship.\\
Yours obediently,\\
Mohammad Samiul Haque\\
Class IX (Science)\\

\part{Report Writing}

\textbf{A.} A Report on the celebration of Victory Day at Rajshahi Collegiate School

Rajshahi Collegiate School observed the Victory Day 2015 in a befitting manner this year. All the students and teachers gathered in the school ground at 7:30 a.m. The day wore a festive look. Every one of the students held a national flag. With a big banner, the teachers and students took out a rally that marched towards the Central Shahid Minar. They sang songs of the liberation war and placed floral wreaths in the pedestal of the Shahid Minar. Hundreds of other organizations also went to the Shahid Minar. About 5000 students of the school joined the programme. Various competitions were held in our school. Throughout the day there were cultural activities of different types. We also commemorated the war martyrs by offering prayers.

\part{Formal and Informal English}

\textbf{B.} Read the following dialogue. Guess the relationship between the two speakers by using their style and tone of speaking. Is the style formal or informal? Show clues in support of your decision.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Robin:} Say, Rumi, how you doing?
    \item \textbf{Rumi:} Robin!, Hey, how are you?
    \item \textbf{Robin:} Not bad. Where you going?
    \item \textbf{Rumi:} Over to Runu’s. How about you?
    \item \textbf{Robin:} I just got off work. Boy, I’m so hungry!
    \item \textbf{Rumi:} Where are you working now?
    \item \textbf{Robin:} Janata Bank. It’s a real pain. But I guess I shouldn’t complain. Lots of guys are out of work these days.
    \item \textbf{Rumi:} Yeah, that’s the truth. Well, I better let you go get some supper.
    \item \textbf{Robin:} Yeah. It was great seeing you again. Maybe we could get together sometime.

    \item \textbf{Rumi:} O.K. Robin. Enjoy your meal.
    \item \textbf{Robin:} Thanks. Bye.
    \item \textbf{Rumi:} Bye.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Informal passage}

\textbf{A.} Discuss what makes the following passage informal.

Well, they had us take a look at the kids every day, and we’d write down lot of things they did and said. There was this one teacher the kids really did things for. This was because she was damn good at maths and could turn the kids on to it. At the end of the week we all got together to talk about what we’d found out since we got there. We all felt that you could pick up an awful lot about how to teach just from watching what the kids did whenever the teacher told them to do something.

\textbf{B.} The passage below is the formal version of the above passage. How is this passage stylistically different from the preceding passage?

We were assigned to observe the teacher daily to record their actions and speech. What impressed us most was one teacher that the boys and girls responded to eagerly because she knew her math thoroughly and made it exciting. At the end of the week, when we met to discuss our conclusions, we agreed that anyone can learn a good deal about teaching methods from merely observing the children’s responses to the teacher’s directions.

Now find out the formal expression used in passage B for the following informal expressions used in Passage A. In the blanks under Formal expressions write down each informal expression.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Informal expressions in passage A} & \textbf{Formal expressions used in passage B} \\
take a look at & \_\_ \\
kids & \_\_ \\
write down & \_\_ \\
damn good at math & \_\_ \\
got together & \_\_ \\
what we’d find out & \_\_ \\
all felt & \_\_ \\
pick up & \_\_ \\
an awful lot & \_\_ \\
what the kids did & \_\_ \\
the teacher told them to do something & \_\_
\end{tabular}

\textbf{Activity 1}

Read the following passage and identify the informal expressions in it. Then change those with formal expressions.

One problem that plagues beginning teachers, and older teachers as well, is the seeming lack of self-control of underprivileged children. Because their homes are often characterized by an awful lot of fragmentation and instability, their behaviour reflects their inability to keep real cool in situations involving adults. .... We think it important, therefore, that the teacher be calm and understanding. For the teacher to be able to exhibit this kind of behavior when confronting a bunch of adolescents, he must have achieved terrific level of integration and security, so that his own psychic life is completely okay.

Each of the following sentences has expressions not suitable for formal writing. Underline those, and give the formal expression for it in the line provided against each sentence.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item He has \underline{a lot of nerve}.\\
    \_\_
    \item There were \underline{a bunch of kids}.\\
    \_\_
    \item We \underline{got out of there in a hurry}.\\
    \_\_
    \item I’ve \underline{got to get a move on}.\\
    \_\_
    \item He is a \underline{pretty nice guy}.\\
    \_\_
    \item War and Peace is an \underline{awfully nice book}.\\
    \_\_
\end{enumerate}
