\section*{Introduction to Lines, Angles, and Triangles}

[Prior knowledge of this chapter is attached in the Appendix at the end of this book. The Appendix should be read or discussed first.]

Geometry, derived from the Greek words 'geo' (earth) and 'metrein' (to measure), meaning 'measurement of land,' originated from the need to measure land in agricultural civilizations. Today, geometry is essential for solving complex mathematical problems beyond land measurement. Evidence of geometry's use exists in ancient civilizations like Egypt, Babylon, India, China, and the Incas. In the Indian subcontinent, the Indus Valley civilization's planned cities, such as Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, show parallel roads and advanced drainage systems, indicating geometric expertise. Vedic altars used precise geometric shapes like triangles and quadrilaterals.

Geometry as a systematic discipline developed in Greek civilization. Thales provided the first geometric proof, showing a circle is bisected by its diameter. His pupil Pythagoras advanced geometric theory, and around 300 BC, Euclid compiled geometric knowledge in his treatise 'Elements,' a 13-chapter foundation of modern geometry. This chapter explores logical geometry based on Euclid's framework.

At the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the basic postulates of plane geometry.
    \item Prove theorems related to triangles.
    \item Apply theorems and corollaries related to triangles to solve problems.
\end{itemize}

\part{Euclid’s Axioms and Postulates}
% Defining the section for Concepts of Space, Plane, Line, and Point
\section*{Concepts of Space, Plane, Line, and Point}

Space is limitless, occupied by solids like sand grains, pencils, books, or planets, studied through their shape, size, and properties in geometry. Solids are three-dimensional, with length, breadth, and height (e.g., a brick or sphere). A solid’s boundary is a surface; a box has six plane surfaces, while a sphere has a curved surface.

A surface is two-dimensional, having only length and breadth, no thickness. Reducing a box’s third dimension to zero yields a surface, like a face of the box. The intersection of two surfaces forms a line (e.g., a box’s edge or a curved line on a sliced lemon). A line is one-dimensional, with length but no breadth or thickness, formed by reducing a surface’s width to zero. Two intersecting lines produce a point, a zero-dimensional entity with no length, breadth, or thickness, formed by reducing a line’s length to zero.

% Defining the section for Euclid’s Axioms and Postulates
\section*{Euclid’s Axioms and Postulates}

Euclid’s descriptions of points, lines, and surfaces in 'Elements' are incomplete by modern standards, as terms like 'part' or 'length' are undefined. His axioms include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A point has no part.
    \item A line has no endpoint.
    \item A line has only length, no breadth or height.
    \item A straight line lies evenly with its points.
    \item A surface has length and breadth only.
    \item Surface edges are lines.
    \item A plane surface lies evenly with straight lines on itself.
\end{enumerate}

Euclid’s general axioms:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Things equal to the same thing are equal to each other.
    \item Adding equals to equals yields equal wholes.
    \item Subtracting equals from equals yields equal remainders.
    \item Things that coincide are equal.
    \item The whole is greater than the part.
\end{enumerate}

In modern geometry, point, line, and plane are undefined, with properties accepted as postulates, chosen for consistency with reality. Euclid’s five postulates:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A straight line can be drawn between any two points.
    \item A terminated line can be extended indefinitely.
    \item A circle can be drawn with any center and radius.
    \item All right angles are equal.
    \item If a line crossing two lines makes interior angles on one side sum to less than two right angles, the lines meet on that side if extended.
\end{enumerate}

Euclid proved 465 propositions using these postulates, forming modern geometry’s foundation. Postulate 1 omits uniqueness of the line through two points, and Postulate 5 is complex, unlike the simpler, self-evident Postulates 1–4, which are accepted without proof.

% Defining the section for Plane Geometry
\section*{Plane Geometry}

Point, straight line, and plane are fundamental geometric concepts. Space is a set of points, with planes and lines as subsets (Postulate 1). Points on a line or plane are described as lying on them, and lines on a plane are said to lie on it. Additional postulates:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[2.] A unique straight line passes through two distinct points.
    \item[3.] A unique plane passes through three non-collinear points.
    \item[4.] A line through two points on a plane lies entirely in the plane.
    \item[5.] (a) Space contains multiple planes. (b) Each plane contains multiple lines. (c) Points on a line correspond one-to-one with real numbers.
\end{enumerate}

These are incidence postulates. Distance is defined by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[6.] (a) Each point pair $P, Q$ has a unique real number distance $PQ$. (b) If $P \neq Q$, $PQ > 0$; else $PQ = 0$. (c) $PQ = QP$ (distance postulate).
    \item[7.] A line’s points correspond to real numbers such that $PQ = |a - b|$, where $P, Q$ map to $a, b$ (ruler postulate).
    \item[8.] Any line $AB$ can be a number line with $A$ at 0 and $B$ positive (ruler placement postulate).
\end{enumerate}

Geometrically, points are drawn as dots, straight lines as ruler-drawn lines with arrows indicating infinite extension. A line $AB$ contains infinite points, and plane geometry, the focus of this text, studies points and lines in a plane.

% Defining the section for Proof of Mathematical Statements
\section*{Proof of Mathematical Statements}

Mathematical propositions are established using elementary concepts, definitions, and postulates, via methods like mathematical induction, deduction, or proof by contradiction. Aristotle’s proof by contradiction relies on:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A property cannot be simultaneously accepted and rejected.
    \item An object cannot have opposite properties.
    \item Nothing can be self-contradictory.
    \item A property attained cannot be unattained simultaneously.
\end{enumerate}

% Defining the section for Geometric Proof
\section*{Geometric Proof}

Geometric propositions, or theorems, are proved logically, often with figures, following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item General enunciation (figure-independent).
    \item Figure and particular enunciation (figure-based).
    \item Necessary constructions.
    \item Logical proof steps.
\end{enumerate}

Corollaries are propositions proved directly from a theorem. Constructions involve drawing figures and justifying their logical validity.

\part{Line, Ray, Line Segment}
% Defining the section for Line, Ray, Line Segment
\section*{Line, Ray, Line Segment}

In a plane, a line $AB$ has a point $C$ internal to $A$ and $B$ if $A, C, B$ are distinct, collinear, and $AC + CB = AB$. The line segment $AB$ includes $A, B$, and all internal points.

\part{Angle}
% Defining the section for Angle
\section*{Angle}

Two rays meeting at a point form an angle, with rays as sides and the common point as the vertex. In $\angle POQ$, $O$ is the vertex, and $OP, OQ$ are sides. The interior region is points on the $Q$ side of $OP$ and $P$ side of $OQ$; the exterior is all other points.

Image description: A figure shows rays $OP$ and $OQ$ forming $\angle POQ$ at vertex $O$, with the interior region shaded between the rays.

\subsection*{Straight Angle}

Two opposite rays at a common endpoint form a straight angle (e.g., $\angle BAC$ formed by rays $AB$ and $AC$ at $A$), measuring $180^\circ$.

Image description: A figure shows rays $AB$ and $AC$ extending oppositely from point $A$, forming a straight line and $\angle BAC$ as a straight angle.

\subsection*{Adjacent Angle}

Two angles with the same vertex, a common side, and lying on opposite sides of that side are adjacent. For example, $\angle BAC$ and $\angle CAD$ share vertex $A$, common side $AC$, and are on opposite sides.

Image description: A figure shows $\angle BAC$ and $\angle CAD$ with vertex $A$, common side $AC$, and non-overlapping regions on either side of $AC$.

\subsection*{Perpendicular and Right Angle}

Two equal adjacent angles on a line form right angles ($90^\circ$). Their sides are perpendicular. In $\angle BAC = \angle DAC = 90^\circ$, $AC \perp BD$.

Image description: A figure shows line $BD$ with ray $AC$ at $A$, forming $\angle BAC$ and $\angle DAC$, both $90^\circ$, with $AC$ perpendicular to $BD$.

\subsection*{Acute and Obtuse Angle}

An angle less than $90^\circ$ is acute (e.g., $\angle AOC$); an angle between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ is obtuse (e.g., $\angle AOD$).

Image description: A figure shows $\angle AOB = 90^\circ$, with $\angle AOC < 90^\circ$ (acute) and $\angle AOD > 90^\circ$ (obtuse).

\subsection*{Reflex Angle}

An angle between $180^\circ$ and $360^\circ$ is a reflex angle (e.g., $\angle AOC$).

Image description: A figure shows $\angle AOC$ as a reflex angle, greater than $180^\circ$ but less than $360^\circ$.

\subsection*{Complementary Angle}

Two angles summing to $90^\circ$ are complementary. In $\angle AOB = 90^\circ$, ray $OC$ forms $\angle AOC$ and $\angle COB$, summing to $90^\circ$.

Image description: A figure shows $\angle AOB = 90^\circ$ with ray $OC$ inside, forming $\angle AOC$ and $\angle COB$, which sum to $90^\circ$.

\subsection*{Supplementary Angle}

Two angles summing to $180^\circ$ are supplementary. For point $O$ on line $AB$, ray $OC$ forms $\angle AOC$ and $\angle COB$, summing to $180^\circ$.

Image description: A figure shows line $AB$ with point $O$, ray $OC$ forming $\angle AOC$ and $\angle COB$, summing to $180^\circ$.

\subsection*{Vertical Angle}

Opposite angles formed by intersecting lines are vertical. For rays $OA, OB$ (opposite) and $OC, OD$ (opposite), $\angle BOD = \angle AOC$ and $\angle BOC = \angle DOA$.

Image description: A figure shows intersecting lines $AB$ and $CD$ at $O$, with $\angle BOD$ opposite $\angle AOC$ and $\angle BOC$ opposite $\angle DOA$.

\textbf{Theorem 1.} The sum of two adjacent angles formed by a ray meeting a straight line equals two right angles.

Solution: Let ray $OC$ meet line $AB$ at $O$, forming $\angle AOC$ and $\angle COB$. Draw $DO \perp AB$.
\[
\angle AOC + \angle COB = \angle AOD + \angle DOC + \angle COB = \angle AOD + \angle DOB = 180^\circ
\]

\textbf{Theorem 2.} Vertically opposite angles formed by intersecting lines are equal.

Solution: Let lines $AB$ and $CD$ intersect at $O$, forming $\angle AOC, \angle COB, \angle BOD, \angle AOD$. By Theorem 1, $\angle AOC + \angle COB = 180^\circ$ and $\angle COB + \angle BOD = 180^\circ$, so $\angle AOC = \angle BOD$. Similarly, $\angle COB = \angle AOD$.

\part{Parallel Lines}
% Defining the section for Parallel Lines
\section*{Parallel Lines}

\subsection*{Alternate Angles, Corresponding Angles, and Interior Angles of the Transversal}

A transversal $EF$ cuts lines $AB$ and $CD$ at $P$ and $Q$, forming angles $\angle 1$ to $\angle 8$. Corresponding angles are $\angle 1, \angle 5$; $\angle 2, \angle 6$; $\angle 3, \angle 7$; $\angle 4, \angle 8$. Alternate angles are $\angle 3, \angle 6$; $\angle 4, \angle 5$. Interior angles are $\angle 4, \angle 6$ (right) and $\angle 3, \angle 5$ (left).

Image description: A figure shows lines $AB$ and $CD$ cut by transversal $EF$ at $P$ and $Q$, forming eight labeled angles, with corresponding, alternate, and interior angles identified.

Two lines in a plane are parallel if they do not intersect, have equal perpendicular distances between points, or have equal corresponding angles with a transversal. Parallel line segments are parts of parallel lines. Euclid’s fifth postulate implies that for parallel lines $AB \parallel CD$ cut by transversal $PQ$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Corresponding angles are equal (e.g., $\angle PEB = \angle EFD$).
    \item Alternate angles are equal (e.g., $\angle AEF = \angle EFD$).
    \item Interior angles on the same side are supplementary (e.g., $\angle BEF + \angle EFD = 180^\circ$).
\end{enumerate}

Image description: A figure shows parallel lines $AB$ and $CD$ cut by transversal $PQ$ at $E$ and $F$, with corresponding, alternate, and interior angles labeled.

If a transversal cuts lines $AB$ and $CD$ such that corresponding angles, alternate angles, or interior angles satisfy the above, then $AB \parallel CD$.

\textbf{Corollary 1.} Lines parallel to the same line are parallel to each other.

\part{Triangle}
% Defining the section for Triangle
\section*{Triangle}

A triangle is a figure enclosed by three line segments (sides), with vertices at their intersections forming three angles. Classified by sides: equilateral (equal sides), isosceles (two equal sides), scalene (unequal sides). By angles: acute (all angles $< 90^\circ$), right (one angle $90^\circ\(\ldots\) \textbf{Theorem 4.} The sum of a triangle’s three angles equals two right angles.

Solution: For $\triangle ABC$, draw $CE \parallel AB$ from $C$. Since $AB \parallel CE$, $\angle ABC = \angle ECD$ (corresponding) and $\angle BAC = \angle ACE$ (alternate).
\[
\angle ABC + \angle BAC + \angle ACB = \angle ECD + \angle ACE + \angle ACB = \angle ACD + \angle ACB = 180^\circ
\]

\textbf{Corollary 2.} An exterior angle equals the sum of the opposite interior angles.

\textbf{Corollary 3.} An exterior angle is greater than each opposite interior angle.

\textbf{Corollary 4.} The acute angles of a right triangle are complementary.

\part{Congruence of Sides and Angles}
% Defining the section for Congruence of Sides and Angles
\section*{Congruence of Sides and Angles}

Congruent line segments have equal lengths; congruent angles have equal measures.

Image description: Two figures show: (i) line segments of equal length labeled congruent, (ii) angles of equal measure labeled congruent.

\part{Congruence of Triangles}
% Defining the section for Congruence of Triangles
\section*{Congruence of Triangles}

Two triangles are congruent if one exactly covers the other, with equal corresponding sides and angles. For $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$, $AB = DE$, $AC = DF$, $BC = EF$, $\angle A = \angle D$, $\angle B = \angle E$, $\angle C = \angle F$.

Image description: A figure shows $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$, with corresponding sides and angles marked equal, indicating congruence.

\textbf{Theorem 5. (Side-Angle-Side Criterion)} If two sides and the included angle of one triangle equal those of another, the triangles are congruent.

Solution: For $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$, if $AB = DE$, $BC = EF$, $\angle ABC = \angle DEF$, then $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$.

\textbf{Theorem 6.} If two sides of a triangle are equal, the opposite angles are equal.

Solution: In $\triangle ABC$, if $AB = AC$, then $\angle ABC = \angle ACB$.

\textbf{Theorem 7.} If two angles of a triangle are equal, the opposite sides are equal.

Solution: In $\triangle ABC$, if $\angle ABC = \angle ACB$, assume $AB \neq AC$. If $AB > AC$, cut $AD = AC$ from $AB$. In $\triangle ADC$, $AD = AC$, so $\angle ADC = \angle ACD$. In $\triangle DBC$, exterior $\angle ADC > \angle ABC$, implying $\angle ACD > \angle ABC$, contradicting $\angle ABC = \angle ACB$. Similarly, $AB < AC$ leads to a contradiction. Thus, $AB = AC$.

\textbf{Theorem 8. (SSS Criterion)} If three sides of one triangle equal those of another, the triangles are congruent.

Solution: For $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$, if $AB = DE$, $AC = DF$, $BC = EF$, then $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$.

\textbf{Theorem 9. (ASA Criterion)} If two angles and the included side of one triangle equal those of another, the triangles are congruent.

Solution: For $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$, if $\angle B = \angle E$, $\angle C = \angle F$, $BC = EF$, then $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$.

\textbf{Theorem 10. (Hypotenuse-Side Criterion)} If the hypotenuse and one side of a right-angled triangle equal those of another, the triangles are congruent.

Solution: For right-angled $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$, if $AC = DF$ (hypotenuses), $AB = DE$, then $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$.

\textbf{Theorem 11.} If one side of a triangle is greater than another, the opposite angle is greater.

Solution: In $\triangle ABC$, if $AC > AB$, then $\angle ABC > \angle ACB$.

\textbf{Theorem 12.} If one angle of a triangle is greater than another, the opposite side is greater.

Solution: In $\triangle ABC$, if $\angle ABC > \angle ACB$, assume $AC \leq AB$. If $AC = AB$, then $\angle ABC = \angle ACB$ (contradiction). If $AC < AB$, then $\angle ABC < \angle ACB$ (contradiction). Thus, $AC > AB$.

\textbf{Theorem 13.} The sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third.

Solution: In $\triangle ABC$, with $BC$ the longest side, $AB + AC > BC$.

\textbf{Corollary 5.} The difference of any two sides is less than the third.

Solution: In $\triangle ABC$, $AB - AC < BC$.

\textbf{Theorem 14.} The line segment joining midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

Solution: In $\triangle ABC$, with $D, E$ midpoints of $AB, AC$, extend $DE$ to $F$ so $EF = DE$. Draw $CF$. In $\triangle ADE \cong \triangle CEF$ (SAS), $\angle ADE = \angle EFC$, so $AD \parallel CF$. Since $BD = AD = CF$ and $BD \parallel CF$, $BDFC$ is a parallelogram, so $DF \parallel BC$, hence $DE \parallel BC$. Also, $DF = BC$, so $2DE = BC$, or $DE = \frac{1}{2}BC$.

\textbf{Theorem 15. (Pythagoras Theorem)} In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other sides.

Solution: In $\triangle ABC$ with $\angle ABC = 90^\circ$, $AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2$.

\textbf{Example 1.} In $\triangle ABC$, $AB = AC$, $BA$ is extended to $D$ with $AD = AC$, and $CD$ is joined.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw the figure.
    \item Prove $BC + CD > 2AC$.
    \item Prove $\angle BCD = 90^\circ$.
\end{enumerate}

Solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    Image description: A figure shows $\triangle ABC$ with $AB = AC$, $BA$ extended to $D$ such that $AD = AC$, and line $CD$ joining $C$ to $D$.
    \item Given $AB = AC = AD$, in $\triangle BCD$, $BC + CD > BD = AB + AD = AD + AD = 2AD$. Since $AD = AC$, $BC + CD > 2AC$.
    \item Since $AB = AC$, $\angle ABC = \angle ACB$, so $\angle DBC = \angle ACB$. Since $AC = AD$, $\angle ADC = \angle ACD$, so $\angle BDC = \angle ACD$. In $\triangle BCD$, $\angle BDC + \angle DBC + \angle BCD = 180^\circ$, or $\angle ACD + \angle ACB + \angle BCD = 180^\circ$. Thus, $2\angle BCD = 180^\circ$, so $\angle BCD = 90^\circ$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example 2.} In $\triangle PQR$, medians $PA, QB, RC$ intersect at $O$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw the figure.
    \item Prove $PQ + PR > QO + RO$.
    \item Prove $PA + QB + RC < PQ + QR + PR$.
\end{enumerate}

Solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    Image description: A figure shows $\triangle PQR$ with medians $PA, QB, RC$ from vertices $P, Q, R$ to midpoints of opposite sides, intersecting at centroid $O$.
    \item In $\triangle PQB$, $PQ + PB > QB$. In $\triangle BOR$, $BR + BO > RO$. Thus, $PQ + PB + BR + BO > QB + RO$. Since $PB + BR = PR$, $PQ + PR + BO > QO + BO + RO$, so $PQ + PR > QO + RO$.
    \item Extend $PA$ to $D$ with $PA = AD$, join $QD$. In $\triangle QAD \cong \triangle PAR$ (SAS), $QD = PR$. In $\triangle PQD$, $PQ + QD > PD$, or $PQ + PR > 2PA$. Similarly, $PQ + QR > 2QB$, $PR + QR > 2RC$. Summing: $2(PQ + QR + PR) > 2(PA + QB + RC)$, so $PA + QB + RC < PQ + QR + PR$.
