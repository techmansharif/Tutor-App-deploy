\section*{Introduction to Sets and Functions}

The term `set' is familiar, as in a dinner set, the set of natural numbers, or the set of rational numbers. As a modern concept, sets have versatile applications. German mathematician George Cantor (1845--1918) first formalized the concept of a set, introducing the notion of infinite sets, which revolutionized mathematical science. His work is now known as set theory. In this chapter, we will solve problems using set concepts, diagrams, and logic, and introduce the idea of functions.

After completing this chapter, learners will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Express the concepts of sets and subsets using symbols.
    \item Describe methods for expressing sets.
    \item Define infinite sets and distinguish between finite and infinite sets.
    \item Define and verify union and intersection of sets.
    \item Define power sets and construct power sets for sets with two or three elements.
    \item Define ordered pairs and Cartesian products.
    \item Prove simple set-theoretic rules using examples and Venn diagrams, and apply these rules to solve problems.
    \item Define relations and functions, and construct them.
    \item Determine domain and range.
    \item Draw diagrams for functions.
\end{itemize}

% Defining the section for Sets
\section*{Sets}

A set is a well-organized collection of real or imaginary objects. For example, the set of three textbooks (Bangla, English, Mathematics), the set of the first 10 odd natural numbers, the set of integers, or the set of real numbers. Sets are denoted by capital letters like $A, B, C, \ldots, X, Y, Z$. For instance, the set of numbers $2, 4, 6$ is denoted as $A = \{2, 4, 6\}$. Each object in a set is called an element. For a set $B = \{a, b\}$, we write $a \in B$ (``$a$ belongs to $B$'') and $b \in B$. If $c$ is not in $B$, we write $c \notin B$ (``$c$ does not belong to $B$'').

\subsection*{Methods for Expressing Sets}

Sets can be expressed using two methods: the Roster Method (Tabular Method) and the Set Builder Method.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Roster Method:} Lists all elements within curly braces, separated by commas if multiple elements exist. Examples: $A = \{a, b\}$, $B = \{2, 4, 6\}$, $C = \{\text{Niloy}, \text{Shuvro}, \text{Tisha}\}$.
    \item \textbf{Set Builder Method:} Describes elements by their common property, using a rule. Examples: $A = \{x : x \text{ is an odd natural number}\}$, $B = \{x : x \text{ is one of the first five students of class IX}\}$. The colon `:' means ``such that.''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example 1.} Express $A = \{7, 14, 21, 28\}$ using the set builder method.

Solution:
The elements of $A$ are $7, 14, 21, 28$, each a multiple of 7 not exceeding 28.
\[
A = \{x : x \text{ is a multiple of } 7 \text{ and } 0 < x \leq 28\}
\]

\textbf{Example 2.} Express $B = \{x : x \text{ is a divisor of } 28\}$ using the roster method.

Solution:
Since $28 = 1 \times 28 = 2 \times 14 = 4 \times 7$, the factors of 28 are $1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28$.
\[
B = \{1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28\}
\]

\textbf{Example 3.} Express $C = \{x : x \text{ is a positive integer and } x^2 < 18\}$ using the roster method.

Solution:
Positive integers are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots$. Compute squares: $1^2 = 1$, $2^2 = 4$, $3^2 = 9$, $4^2 = 16$, $5^2 = 25$. Since $25 > 18$, acceptable integers are $1, 2, 3, 4$.
\[
C = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}
\]

\subsection*{Finite and Infinite Sets}

\textbf{Finite Set:} A set whose elements can be counted is a finite set. Examples: $D = \{x, y, z\}$ (3 elements), $E = \{3, 6, 9, \ldots, 60\}$ (20 elements), $F = \{x : x \text{ is prime and } 30 < x < 70\}$ (9 elements).

\textbf{Infinite Set:} A set whose elements cannot be exhausted by counting is an infinite set. Examples: $A = \{x : x \text{ is an odd natural number}\}$, natural numbers $N = \{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}$, integers $Z = \{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$, rational numbers $Q = \left\{\frac{a}{b} : a, b \text{ are integers and } b \neq 0\right\}$, real numbers $R$.

\textbf{Example 4.} Prove that the set of all natural numbers is an infinite set.

Solution:
Suppose the set of natural numbers $N$ is finite, with a maximum element $K \in N$. By the definition of natural numbers, if $K$ is a natural number, then $K+1$ is also a natural number and greater than $K$, so $K+1 \in N$. This contradicts the assumption that $K$ is the maximum element. Similarly, $K+2, K+3, \ldots$ are in $N$. Thus, $N$ cannot be finite and is an infinite set.

\subsection*{Empty Set}

An empty set, denoted by $\varnothing$, has no elements. Examples: the set of three male students in a girls' school, $\{x \in N : 10 < x < 11\}$, $\{x \in N : x \text{ is prime and } 23 < x < 29\}$.

\subsection*{Venn Diagram}

John Venn (1834--1923) represented sets using geometric figures like rectangles, circles, and triangles in a plane, called Venn diagrams.

% Image description for Venn diagram placeholders
% The document includes placeholders for Venn diagrams illustrating set operations like union ($A \cup B$), intersection ($A \cap B$), and intersection of three sets ($A \cap B \cap C$). These diagrams typically show circles representing sets within a rectangular universal set, with shaded regions indicating the operation's result.

\part{Subsets}
\subsection*{Subset}

For a set $A = \{a, b\}$, possible subsets are $\{a, b\}$, $\{a\}$, $\{b\}$, $\varnothing$. A subset contains some or all elements of the original set, denoted by $\subseteq$. If $B \subseteq A$, every element of $B$ is in $A$. Every set is a subset of itself, and $\varnothing$ is a subset of any set. For $P = \{1, 2, 3\}$, subsets include $P$, $Q = \{2, 3\}$, $R = \{1, 3\}$, so $P \subseteq P$, $Q \subseteq P$, $R \subseteq P$.

\subsection*{Proper Subset}

A proper subset has fewer elements than the original set, denoted by $\subset$. For $A = \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$ and $B = \{3, 5\}$, $B \subset A$ because $B$ has fewer elements. For $P = \{1, 2, 3\}$, $Q$ and $R$ are proper subsets. The empty set $\varnothing$ is a proper subset of any non-empty set.

\textbf{Example 5.} Write down the subsets of $P = \{x, y, z\}$ and identify the proper subsets.

Solution:
Subsets of $P$ are $\{x, y, z\}$, $\{x, y\}$, $\{x, z\}$, $\{y, z\}$, $\{x\}$, $\{y\}$, $\{z\}$, $\varnothing$. Proper subsets are $\{x, y\}$, $\{x, z\}$, $\{y, z\}$, $\{x\}$, $\{y\}$, $\{z\}$, $\varnothing$.

\textbf{Observation:} A set with $n$ elements has $2^n$ subsets and $2^n - 1$ proper subsets.

\part{Operations of Sets}
\subsection*{Equivalent Set}

Two sets with the same elements are equivalent, denoted by $=$. For $A = \{3, 5, 7\}$ and $B = \{5, 3, 3, 7\}$, $A = B$ because $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$. For $A = \{3, 5, 7\}$, $B = \{5, 3, 3, 7\}$, $C = \{7, 7, 3, 5, 5\}$, $A = B = C$. Changing the order or repeating elements does not change the set.

\subsection*{Difference of Sets}

For $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and $B = \{3, 5\}$, the set difference $A \backslash B$ (or $A - B$) is $\{1, 2, 4\}$, containing elements in $A$ but not in $B$.
\[
A - B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} - \{3, 5\} = \{1, 2, 4\}
\]

\textbf{Example 6.} If $P = \{x : x \text{ is a factor of } 12\}$ and $Q = \{x : x \text{ is a multiple of } 3 \text{ and } x \leq 12\}$, determine $P - Q$.

Solution:
Factors of 12 are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$, so $P = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\}$. Multiples of 3 up to 12 are $3, 6, 9, 12$, so $Q = \{3, 6, 9, 12\}$.
\[
P - Q = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\} - \{3, 6, 9, 12\} = \{1, 2, 4\}
\]

\subsection*{Universal Set}

All sets under discussion are subsets of a universal set, denoted by $U$. For example, if $C = \{2, 4, 6, \ldots\}$ (even natural numbers) and $N = \{1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\}$ (natural numbers), $N$ is the universal set for $C$.

\subsection*{Complement of a Set}

For a universal set $U$ and subset $A$, the complement $A^c$ (or $A'$) is $U \backslash A$, containing elements not in $A$. For sets $P$ and $Q$, the complement of $P$ with respect to $Q$ is $Q^c = P \backslash Q$.

\textbf{Example 7.} If $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$, $A = \{2, 4, 6, 7\}$, $B = \{1, 3, 5\}$, determine $A^c$ and $B^c$.

Solution:
\[
A^c = U \backslash A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\} \backslash \{2, 4, 6, 7\} = \{1, 3, 5\}
\]
\[
B^c = U \backslash B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\} \backslash \{1, 3, 5\} = \{2, 4, 6, 7\}
\]

\subsection*{Union of Sets}

The union of sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cup B$, contains all elements in $A$ or $B$.
\[
A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}
\]

\textbf{Example 8.} If $C = \{3, 4, 5\}$ and $D = \{4, 6, 8\}$, determine $C \cup D$.

Solution:
\[
C \cup D = \{3, 4, 5\} \cup \{4, 6, 8\} = \{3, 4, 5, 6, 8\}
\]

\subsection*{Intersection of Sets}

The intersection of sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cap B$, contains elements common to both.
\[
A \cap B = \{x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}
\]

\textbf{Example 9.} If $P = \{x \in N : 2 < x \leq 6\}$ and $Q = \{x \in N : x \text{ is even and } x \leq 8\}$, determine $P \cap Q$.

Solution:
\[
P = \{3, 4, 5, 6\}, \quad Q = \{2, 4, 6, 8\}
\]
\[
P \cap Q = \{3, 4, 5, 6\} \cap \{2, 4, 6, 8\} = \{4, 6\}
\]

\subsection*{Disjoint Set}

Sets $A$ and $B$ are disjoint if $A \cap B = \varnothing$.

\subsection*{Power Sets}

For a set $A = \{m, n\}$, subsets are $\{m, n\}$, $\{m\}$, $\{n\}$, $\varnothing$. The set of all subsets, $\{\{m, n\}, \{m\}, \{n\}, \varnothing\}$, is the power set, denoted $P(A)$.

\textbf{Example 10.} Find the number of elements in the power sets of $A = \varnothing$, $B = \{a\}$, $C = \{a, b\}$.

Solution:
\[
P(A) = \{\varnothing\}, \quad \text{Number of elements} = 2^0 = 1
\]
\[
P(B) = \{\{a\}, \varnothing\}, \quad \text{Number of elements} = 2^1 = 2
\]
\[
P(C) = \{\{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}, \varnothing\}, \quad \text{Number of elements} = 2^2 = 4
\]
A set with $n$ elements has $2^n$ elements in its power set.

\textbf{Example 13.} Determine the natural numbers that leave a residue of 23 when dividing 311 and 419.

Solution:
The numbers must be greater than 23 and common factors of $311 - 23 = 288$ and $419 - 23 = 396$. Factors of 288: $288 = 1 \times 288 = 2 \times 144 = 3 \times 96 = 4 \times 72 = 6 \times 48 = 8 \times 36 = 9 \times 32 = 12 \times 24 = 16 \times 18$, so $A = \{24, 32, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, 288\}$. Factors of 396: $396 = 1 \times 396 = 2 \times 198 = 3 \times 132 = 4 \times 99 = 6 \times 66 = 9 \times 44 = 11 \times 36 = 12 \times 33 = 18 \times 22$, so $B = \{33, 36, 44, 66, 99, 132, 198, 396\}$.
\[
A \cap B = \{36\}
\]
The required set is $\{36\}$.

\textbf{Example 14.} Of 100 students, 88 passed in Bangla, 80 in Mathematics, and 70 in both. Express this in a Venn diagram and find how many failed in both subjects.

Solution:
The universal set $U$ is 100 students, with sets $B$ (Bangla) and $M$ (Mathematics). The Venn diagram divides into four disjoint sets: $P$ (Bangla only), $Q = B \cap M$ (both), $R$ (Mathematics only), $F$ (failed both). Given $|Q| = 70$, $|P| = 88 - 70 = 18$, $|R| = 80 - 70 = 10$. Students passing at least one subject: $|P \cup Q \cup R| = 18 + 10 + 70 = 98$. Failed both: $|F| = 100 - 98 = 2$. Thus, 2 students failed both subjects.

% Image description for Venn diagram
% The Venn diagram shows a rectangle representing the universal set of 100 students, with two overlapping circles for sets $B$ (Bangla) and $M$ (Mathematics). The intersection $B \cap M$ (70 students) is shaded, with $P$ (18 students) in $B$ only, $R$ (10 students) in $M$ only, and $F$ (2 students) outside both circles.

\textbf{Example 24.} Let $U = \{x : x \in N \text{ and } x \leq 6\}$, $A = \{x : x \text{ prime and } x \leq 5\}$, $B = \{x : x \text{ even and } x \leq 6\}$, $C = A \backslash B$. Determine:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A^c$
    \item Prove $A \cup B = (A \backslash B) \cup (B \backslash A) \cup (A \cap B)$
    \item Prove $(A \cap C) \times B = (A \times B) \cap (C \times B)$
\end{enumerate}

Solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$, $A = \{2, 3, 5\}$.
    \[
    A^c = U \backslash A = \{1, 4, 6\}
    \]
    \item $B = \{2, 4, 6\}$.
    \[
    A \cup B = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
    \]
    \[
    A \backslash B = \{3, 5\}, \quad B \backslash A = \{4, 6\}, \quad A \cap B = \{2\}
    \]
    \[
    (A \backslash B) \cup (B \backslash A) \cup (A \cap B) = \{3, 5\} \cup \{4, 6\} \cup \{2\} = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
    \]
    Thus, $A \cup B = (A \backslash B) \cup (B \backslash A) \cup (A \cap B)$.
    \item $C = A \backslash B = \{3, 5\}$.
    \[
    A \cap C = \{2, 3, 5\} \cap \{3, 5\} = \{3, 5\}
    \]
    \[
    (A \cap C) \times B = \{3, 5\} \times \{2, 4, 6\} = \{(3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)\}
    \]
    \[
    A \times B = \{(2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)\}
    \]
    \[
    C \times B = \{(3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)\}
    \]
    \[
    (A \times B) \cap (C \times B) = \{(3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)\}
    \]
    Thus, $(A \cap C) \times B = (A \times B) \cap (C \times B)$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Example 25.} Let $A = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$, $B = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$, $R = \{(x, y) : x \in A, y \in A \text{ and } y = x + 1\}$. Prove:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $A$ and $B$ are mutually disjoint.
    \item Determine $P(B)$ and show its number of elements is $2^n$.
    \item Express $R$ in tabular method and determine its domain.
\end{enumerate}

Solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \[
    A \cap B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\} \cap \{0, 1, 2, 3\} = \varnothing
    \]
    Thus, $A$ and $B$ are mutually disjoint.
    \item \[
    P(B) = \{\{0\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{0, 1\}, \{0, 2\}, \{0, 3\}, \{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{2, 3\}, \{0, 1, 2\}, \{0, 1, 3\}, \{0, 2, 3\}, \{1, 2, 3\}, \{0, 1, 2, 3\}, \varnothing\}
    \]
    Number of elements in $B$ is 4, so $|P(B)| = 2^4 = 16$.
    \item \[
    \begin{array}{c|cccc}
    x & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
    \hline
    y & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    Since $8 \notin A$, $(7, 8) \notin R$.
    \[
    R = \{(4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7)\}, \quad \text{Dom } R = \{4, 5, 6\}
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\part{Ordered Pairs and Cartesian Product}
\subsection*{Ordered Pair}

An ordered pair, e.g., (Amena, Sumena) for first and second positions, specifies positions. Denoted $(x, y)$, two ordered pairs $(x, y) = (a, b)$ if $x = a$ and $y = b$.

\textbf{Example 11.} If $(2x + y, 3) = (6, x - y)$, determine $(x, y)$.

Solution:
\[
2x + y = 6 \quad (1), \quad 3 = x - y \quad (2)
\]
Add (1) and (2):
\[
(2x + y) + (x - y) = 6 + 3 \implies 3x = 9 \implies x = 3
\]
Substitute $x = 3$ in (1):
\[
6 + y = 6 \implies y = 0
\]
\[
(x, y) = (3, 0)
\]

\subsection*{Cartesian Product}

For sets $A = \{\text{white}, \text{blue}\}$ and $B = \{\text{red}, \text{yellow}, \text{green}\}$, the Cartesian product $A \times B$ is:
\[
A \times B = \{(\text{white}, \text{red}), (\text{white}, \text{yellow}), (\text{white}, \text{green}), (\text{blue}, \text{red}), (\text{blue}, \text{yellow}), (\text{blue}, \text{green})\}
\]
\[
A \times B = \{(x, y) : x \in A \text{ and } y \in B\}
\]

\textbf{Example 12.} If $P = \{1, 2, 3\}$, $Q = \{3, 4\}$, $R = P \cap Q$, determine $P \times R$ and $R \times Q$.

Solution:
\[
R = P \cap Q = \{1, 2, 3\} \cap \{3, 4\} = \{3\}
\]
\[
P \times R = \{1, 2, 3\} \times \{3\} = \{(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)\}
\]
\[
R \times Q = \{3\} \times \{3, 4\} = \{(3, 3), (3, 4)\}
\]

\part{Relations}
\section*{Relations}

A relation, such as the country-capital relation $\{(\text{Bangladesh}, \text{Dhaka}), (\text{India}, \text{New Delhi}), (\text{Thailand}, \text{Bangkok})\}$, is a non-empty subset $R$ of the Cartesian product $A \times B$, i.e., $R \subseteq A \times B$. If $(x, y) \in R$, we write $x R y$ (``$x$ is related to $y$'').

\textbf{Example 15.} For $A = \{3, 5\}$, $B = \{2, 4\}$, determine relations.

Solution:
\[
A \times B = \{(3, 2), (3, 4), (5, 2), (5, 4)\}
\]
For $x > y$, $R = \{(3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4)\}$. For $x < y$, $R = \{(3, 4)\}$.

\textbf{Example 16.} If $P = \{2, 3, 4\}$, $Q = \{4, 6\}$, and the relation is $y = 2x$, find the relations.

Solution:
\[
P \times Q = \{(2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 4), (4, 6)\}
\]
For $y = 2x$: $(2, 4)$ ($4 = 2 \cdot 2$), $(3, 6)$ ($6 = 2 \cdot 3$).
\[
R = \{(2, 4), (3, 6)\}
\]

\textbf{Example 17.} If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, $B = \{0, 2, 4\}$, and the relation is $x = y - 1$, find the relations.

Solution:
\[
A \times B = \{(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4)\}
\]
For $x = y - 1$: $(1, 2)$ ($1 = 2 - 1$), $(3, 4)$ ($3 = 4 - 1$).
\[
R = \{(1, 2), (3, 4)\}
\]

\part{Functions}
\section*{Functions}

For a relation $y = x + 2$, each $x$ maps to exactly one $y$ (e.g., $x=1 \implies y=3$). Such a relation is a function, denoted $y = f(x)$. For $y = x^2 - 2x + 3$, each $x$ yields one $y$. Here, $x$ is the independent variable, and $y$ is the dependent variable.

\textbf{Example 18.} If $f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3$, determine $f(-1)$.

Solution:
\[
f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 4(-1) + 3 = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8
\]

\textbf{Example 19.} If $g(x) = x^3 + ax^2 - 3x - 6$, find $a$ such that $g(-2) = 0$.

Solution:
\[
g(-2) = (-2)^3 + a(-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 6 = -8 + 4a + 6 - 6 = 4a - 8
\]
Set $g(-2) = 0$:
\[
4a - 8 = 0 \implies 4a = 8 \implies a = 2
\]

\textbf{Example 23.} If $f(y) = \frac{y^3 - 3y^2 + 1}{y(1 - y)}$, show that $f\left(\frac{1}{y}\right) = f(1 - y)$.

Solution:
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{y}\right) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)^3 - 3\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)^2 + 1}{\frac{1}{y}\left(1 - \frac{1}{y}\right)} = \frac{\frac{1}{y^3} - \frac{3}{y^2} + 1}{\frac{1}{y} \cdot \frac{y - 1}{y}} = \frac{\frac{1 - 3y + y^3}{y^3}}{\frac{y - 1}{y^2}} = \frac{1 - 3y + y^3}{y(y - 1)}
\]
\[
f(1 - y) = \frac{(1 - y)^3 - 3(1 - y)^2 + 1}{(1 - y)(1 - (1 - y))} = \frac{1 - 3y + 3y^2 - y^3 - 3(1 - 2y + y^2) + 1}{y(1 - y)}
\]
\[
= \frac{1 - 3y + 3y^2 - y^3 - 3 + 6y - 3y^2 + 1}{y(1 - y)} = \frac{-y^3 + 3y - 1}{y(1 - y)} = \frac{1 - 3y + y^3}{y(y - 1)}
\]
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{y}\right) = f(1 - y)
\]

\part{Domain and Range}
\subsection*{Domain and Range}

For a relation $R \subseteq A \times B$, the set of first elements is the domain (Dom $R$), and the set of second elements is the range (Range $R$).

\textbf{Example 20.} Find the domain and range of $S = \{(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 5)\}$.

Solution:
First elements: $2, 2, 3, 4$. Second elements: $1, 2, 2, 5$.
\[
\text{Dom } S = \{2, 3, 4\}, \quad \text{Range } S = \{1, 2, 5\}
\]

\textbf{Example 21.} If $A = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$, $R = \{(x, y) : x \in A, y \in A \text{ and } y = x + 1\}$, express $R$ in tabular method and determine Dom $R$ and Range $R$.

Solution:
\[

Since $4 \notin A$, $(3, 4) \notin R$.
\[
R = \{(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)\}
\]
\[
\text{Dom } R = \{0, 1, 2\}, \quad \text{Range } R = \{1, 2, 3\}

\part{Graph of a Function}
\subsection*{Graph of a Function}

A function's visual representation is its graph. René Descartes (1596--1650) introduced Cartesian coordinates, defining points in a plane using two perpendicular axes: $x$-axis ($XOX'$) and $y$-axis ($YOY'$), intersecting at the origin $O$. For a point $P$, perpendicular distances $PM$ (to $y$-axis) and $PN$ (to $x$-axis) give coordinates $(x, y)$, where $x$ is the abscissa and $y$ the ordinate. To graph $y = f(x)$, select $x$ values from the domain, compute $y$, plot ordered pairs, and connect points.

\textbf{Example 22.} Draw the graph of $y = 2x$, where $-3 \leq x \leq 3$.

Solution:
\[
\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}
x & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
y & -6 & -4 & -2 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 6 \\
\end{array}
\]
Plot points $(-3, -6)$, $(-2, -4)$, $(-1, -2)$, $(0, 0)$, $(1, 2)$, $(2, 4)$, $(3, 6)$ and connect them.

% Image description for graph
% The graph of $y = 2x$ is a straight line passing through points like $(-3, -6)$, $(0, 0)$, and $(3, 6)$ on a Cartesian plane, with $x$-axis ranging from $-3$ to $3$ and $y$-axis scaled accordingly.
