\section*{Introduction}
Owing to the contribution of information and data, the world has become a global village for the rapid advancement of science and information. Globalization has been made possible due to rapid transformation and expansion of information and data. So, to keep the continuity of development and for participating and contributing in globalization, it is essential for students at this stage to have clear knowledge about information and data. In this context, to meet the demands of students in acquiring knowledge, information and data have been discussed from class VI, and class-wise contents have been arranged step by step. In continuation of this, the students of this class will know and learn cumulative frequency, frequency polygon, ogive curve in measuring central tendency mean, median, mode, etc., in short-cut method.

At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain cumulative frequency, frequency polygon, and ogive curve.
    \item Explain data by the frequency polygon and ogive curve.
    \item Explain the method of measuring central tendency.
    \item Explain the necessity of short-cut method in the measurement of central tendency.
    \item Find the mean, median, and mode by the short-cut method.
    \item Explain the diagram of frequency polygon and ogive curve.
\end{itemize}

\part{Presentation of Data}
% Defining the section for Presentation of Data
\section*{Presentation of Data}
We know that numerical information which is not qualitative is the data of statistics. The data under investigation are the raw materials of statistics. They are in unorganized form, and it is not possible to take necessary decisions directly from the unorganized data. It is necessary to organize and tabulate the data, and the tabulation of data is the presentation of the data. In the previous class, we have learnt how to organize the data in tabulation. We know that it is required to determine the range of data for tabulation. Then, determining the class interval and the number of classes by using tally marks, the frequency distribution table is made. Here, the methods of making a frequency distribution table are to be re-discussed through an example for convenient understanding.

\subsection*{Example 1}
In a winter season, the temperature (in Celsius) of the month of January in the district of Srimangal is placed below. Find the frequency distribution table of the temperature:
\[
14^\circ, 14^\circ, 14^\circ, 13^\circ, 12^\circ, 13^\circ, 10^\circ, 10^\circ, 11^\circ, 12^\circ, 11^\circ, 10^\circ, 9^\circ, 8^\circ, 9^\circ, 11^\circ, 10^\circ, 10^\circ, 8^\circ, 9^\circ, 7^\circ, 6^\circ, 6^\circ, 6^\circ, 6^\circ, 7^\circ, 8^\circ, 9^\circ, 9^\circ, 8^\circ, 7^\circ
\]

Solution: Here, the minimum and maximum numerical values of the temperature data are 6 and 14, respectively. Hence, the range is:
\[
(14 - 6) + 1 = 9
\]
If the class interval is considered to be 3, the number of classes will be $\frac{9}{3} = 3$. Considering 3 as the class interval, if the data are arranged in 3 classes, the frequency table will be:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Temperature (in Celsius) & Tally & Frequency \\
\hline
$6^\circ - 8^\circ$ & $\mathbb{N} \mathbb{N} \mathbb{N}$ & 11 \\
$9^\circ - 11^\circ$ & $\mathbb{N} \mathbb{N} \mathbb{N}$ & 13 \\
$12^\circ - 14^\circ$ & $\mathbb{N} \mathbb{N}$ & 7 \\
\hline
Total & & 31 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% Defining the section for Cumulative Frequency
\section*{Cumulative Frequency}
In Example 1, considering 3 as the class interval and determining the number of classes, the frequency distribution table has been made. The number of classes of the mentioned data is 3. The limit of the first class is $6^\circ - 8^\circ$. The lowest range of the class is $6^\circ$, and the highest range is $8^\circ$. The frequency of this class is 11. Similarly, the limit of the second class is $9^\circ - 11^\circ$, and the frequency of this class is 13. Now, if the frequency 11 of the first class is added to the frequency 13 of the second class, we get 24. This 24 will be the cumulative frequency of the second class, and the cumulative frequency of the first class, as it begins with the class, will be 11. Again, if the cumulative frequency 24 of the second class is added to the frequency of the third class, we get $24 + 7 = 31$, which is the cumulative frequency of the third class. Thus, the cumulative frequency distribution table is made. In the context of the above discussion, the cumulative frequency distribution of temperature in Example 1 is as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Temperature (in Celsius) & Frequency & Cumulative Frequency \\
\hline
$6^\circ - 8^\circ$ & 11 & 11 \\
$9^\circ - 11^\circ$ & 13 & $11 + 13 = 24$ \\
$12^\circ - 14^\circ$ & 7 & $24 + 7 = 31$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Example 2}
The marks obtained in English by 40 students in an annual examination are given below. Make a cumulative frequency table of the marks obtained:
\[
70, 40, 35, 60, 55, 58, 45, 60, 65, 80, 70, 46, 50, 60, 65, 70, 58, 60, 48, 70, 36, 85, 60, 50, 46, 65, 55, 61, 72, 85, 90, 68, 65, 50, 40, 56, 60, 65, 46, 76
\]

Solution: Range of the data = (highest numerical value - lowest numerical value) + 1 = $(90 - 35) + 1 = 55 + 1 = 56$. Let the class interval be 5, then the number of classes = $\frac{56}{5} = 11.2$ or 12 (taking the immediate next integer when class interval is fractional). Hence, the cumulative frequency distribution table at a class interval of 5 will be:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Obtained marks & Tally & Frequency & Cumulative frequency \\
\hline
$35-39$ & $\|$ & 2 & 2 \\
$40-44$ & $\|$ & 2 & $2 + 2 = 4$ \\
$45-49$ & $\mathbb{N}$ & 5 & $5 + 4 = 9$ \\
$50-54$ & $\|$ & 3 & $3 + 9 = 12$ \\
$55-59$ & $\mathbb{N}$ & 5 & $5 + 12 = 17$ \\
$60-64$ & $\mathbb{N}$ & 7 & $7 + 17 = 24$ \\
$65-69$ & $\mathbb{N}$ & 6 & $6 + 24 = 30$ \\
$70-74$ & $\mathbb{N}$ & 5 & $5 + 30 = 35$ \\
$75-79$ & $\|$ & 1 & $1 + 35 = 36$ \\
$80-84$ & $\|$ & 1 & $1 + 36 = 37$ \\
$85-89$ & $\|$ & 2 & $2 + 37 = 39$ \\
$90-94$ & $\|$ & 1 & $1 + 39 = 40$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% Defining the section for Variable
\section*{Variable}
We know that the numerical information is the data of statistics. The numbers used in data are variables. For example, in Example 1, the numbers indicating temperatures are variables. Similarly, in Example 2, the secured marks used in the data are the variables.

\subsection*{Discrete and Indiscrete Variable}
The variables used in statistics are of two types: discrete and indiscrete variables. The variables whose values are only integers are discrete variables. The marks obtained in Example 2 are discrete variables. Similarly, only integers are used in population-indicated data, which is why the variables of data used for population are discrete variables. The variables whose numerical values can be any real number are indiscrete variables. For example, in Example 1, the temperature-indicated data can be any real number. Besides, any real number can be used for the data related to age, height, weight, etc. That is why the variables used for those are indiscrete variables. The number between two indiscrete variables can be the value of those variables. Sometimes it becomes necessary to make class intervals indiscrete. To make the class interval indiscrete, the actual higher limit of a class and the lower limit of the next class are determined by fixing the mid-point of a higher limit of any class and the lower limit of the next class. For example, in Example 1, the actual higher-lower limits of the first class are $8.5^\circ$ and $5.5^\circ$, respectively, and those of the second class are $11.5^\circ$ and $8.5^\circ$, etc.

\part{Diagram of Data}
% Defining the section for Diagram of Data
\section*{Diagram of Data}
We have seen that the collected data under investigation are the raw materials of statistics. If the frequency distribution and cumulative frequency distribution tables are made with them, it becomes clear to comprehend and to draw a conclusion. If those tabulated data are presented through diagrams, they become easier to understand as well as attractive. That is why the presentation of statistical data in tabulation and diagrams is a widely and frequently used method. In class VIII, different types of diagrams in the form of line graphs and histograms have been discussed elaborately, and the students have been taught how to draw them. Here, how frequency polygons, pie-charts, and ogive curves are drawn from frequency distribution and cumulative frequency tables will be discussed.

% Defining the section for Frequency Polygon
\section*{Frequency Polygon}
In class VIII, we have learnt how to draw the histogram of discrete data. Here, how to draw a frequency polygon from a histogram of indiscrete data will be discussed through an example.

\subsection*{Example 3}
The frequency distribution table of the weights (in kg) of 60 students of class X of a school is given below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Weight (kg) & $46-50$ & $51-55$ & $56-60$ & $61-65$ & $66-70$ \\
\hline
Frequency (No. of students) & 5 & 10 & 20 & 15 & 10 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

1) Draw the histogram of frequency distribution.
2) Draw the frequency polygon of the histogram.

Solution: The class interval of the data in the table is discrete. If the class intervals are made indiscrete, the table will be:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval of the weight (in kg) & Indiscrete class interval & Mid-point of class & Frequency \\
\hline
$46-50$ & $45.5-50.5$ & 48 & 5 \\
$51-55$ & $50.5-55.5$ & 53 & 10 \\
$56-60$ & $55.5-60.5$ & 58 & 20 \\
$61-65$ & $60.5-65.5$ & 63 & 15 \\
$66-70$ & $65.5-70.5$ & 68 & 10 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

1) The histogram has been drawn taking each square of graph paper as 5 units of class interval along the x-axis and frequency along the y-axis. The class interval along the x-axis has started from -supply chain45.5. The broken segments $\triangle$ have been used to show the presence of previous squares starting from the origin to 45.5.
2) The mid-points of the opposite sides parallel to the base of the rectangle of the histogram have been fixed for drawing the frequency polygon from the histogram. The mid-points have been joined by line segments to draw the frequency polygon. The mid-points of the first and the last rectangles have been joined with the x-axis representing the class interval by the end points of line segments to make the frequency polygon attractive.

Image description: The figure shows a histogram with indiscrete class intervals from 45.5 to 70.5 kg on the x-axis and frequencies up to 20 on the y-axis. Rectangles represent the frequency for each class, with mid-points at 48, 53, 58, 63, and 68 kg. A frequency polygon is overlaid, connecting these mid-points and extending to the x-axis at 40.5 and 75.5 kg to close the polygon.

\subsection*{Frequency Polygon Definition}
The diagram drawn by joining frequency-indicated points opposite to the class interval of indiscrete data by line segments successively is a frequency polygon.

\subsection*{Example 4}
Draw a polygon of the following frequency distribution table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & $10-20$ & $20-30$ & $30-40$ & $40-50$ & $50-60$ & $60-70$ & $70-80$ & $80-90$ \\
\hline
Mid-point & 15 & 25 & 35 & 45 & 55 & 65 & 75 & 85 \\
\hline
Frequency & 8 & 10 & 15 & 30 & 45 & 41 & 15 & 7 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Solution: The histogram of frequency distribution is drawn taking each square of graph paper as 10 units of class interval along the x-axis and each square of graph paper as 5 units of frequency along the y-axis. The mid-points of the sides opposite to the base of the rectangle of the histogram are identified, which are the mid-points of the class. Now, the fixed mid-points are joined. The end-points of the first and last classes are joined to the x-axis representing the class interval to draw the frequency polygon.

Image description: The figure displays a histogram with class intervals from 10 to 90 on the x-axis and frequencies up to 45 on the y-axis. A frequency polygon is drawn by connecting the mid-points of each class (15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85) with line segments, extending to the x-axis at 5 and 95 to complete the polygon.

\subsection*{Example 5}
The frequency distribution table of the marks obtained by 50 students of class X in science is given. Draw the frequency polygon of the data (without using histogram):

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & $31-40$ & $41-50$ & $51-60$ & $61-70$ & $71-80$ & $81-90$ & $91-100$ \\
\hline
Frequency & 6 & 8 & 10 & 12 & 5 & 7 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Solution: Here, the given data are discrete. In this case, it is convenient to draw the frequency polygon directly by finding the mid-point of the class interval. The mid-point of the first class interval $(31-40)$ is $\frac{31+40}{2} = 35.5$. The table is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & $31-40$ & $41-50$ & $51-60$ & $61-70$ & $71-80$ & $81-90$ & $91-100$ \\
\hline
Mid-point & 35.5 & 45.5 & 55.5 & 65.5 & 75.5 & 85.5 & 95.5 \\
\hline
Frequency & 6 & 8 & 10 & 12 & 5 & 7 & 2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The polygon is drawn by taking each square of graph paper as 1 unit of mid-points of class interval along the x-axis and taking each square of graph paper as 2 units of frequency along the y-axis.

Image description: The figure shows a frequency polygon plotted with mid-points (35.5, 45.5, 55.5, 65.5, 75.5, 85.5, 95.5) on the x-axis and corresponding frequencies (6, 8, 10, 12, 5, 7, 2) on the y-axis. The points are connected by line segments, with extensions to the x-axis at approximately 25.5 and 105.5 to close the polygon.

% Defining the section for Cumulative Frequency Diagram or Ogive Curve
\section*{Cumulative Frequency Diagram or Ogive Curve}
A cumulative frequency diagram or ogive curve is drawn by taking the upper limit of the class interval along the x-axis and cumulative frequency along the y-axis after classification of a data.

\subsection*{Example 6}
The frequency distribution table of the marks obtained by 50 students out of 60 students is as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval of marks obtained & $1-10$ & $11-20$ & $21-30$ & $31-40$ & $41-50$ \\
\hline
Frequency & 8 & 12 & 15 & 18 & 7 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Draw the ogive curve of this frequency distribution.

Solution: The cumulative frequency table of the frequency distribution of the given data is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval of marks obtained & Frequency & Cumulative Frequency \\
\hline
$1-10$ & 8 & 8 \\
$11-20$ & 12 & $8 + 12 = 20$ \\
$21-30$ & 15 & $15 + 20 = 35$ \\
$31-40$ & 18 & $18 + 35 = 53$ \\
$41-50$ & 7 & $7 + 53 = 60$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The ogive curve of cumulative frequency of data is drawn taking each square of graph paper as two units of the upper limit of class interval along the x-axis and cumulative frequency along the y-axis.

Image description: The figure displays an ogive curve with the upper limits of class intervals (10, 20, 30, 40, 50) on the x-axis and cumulative frequencies (8, 20, 35, 53, 60) on the y-axis. The points are plotted and connected by smooth line segments to form a rising curve starting from the origin.

\part{Central Tendency}
% Defining the section for Central Tendency
\section*{Central Tendency}
Central tendency and its measurement have been discussed in classes VII and VIII. We have seen that if the data under investigation are arranged in order of values, the data cluster around a central value. Again, if the disorganized data are placed in a frequency distribution table, the frequency is found to be abundant in a middle class, i.e., the frequency is maximum in the middle class. In fact, the tendency of data to be clustered around the central value is a number, and it represents the data. The central tendency is measured by this number. Generally, the measurement of central tendency is of three types: (1) Arithmetic mean, (2) Median, (3) Mode.

% Defining the section for Arithmetic Mean
\section*{Arithmetic Mean}
We know that if the sum of data is divided by the number of data, we get the arithmetic mean. But this method is complex, time-consuming, and there is every possibility of committing a mistake for large numbers of data. In such cases, the data are tabulated through classification, and the arithmetic mean is determined by the short-cut method.

\subsection*{Example 7}
The frequency distribution table of the marks obtained by the students of a class is as follows. Find the arithmetic mean of the marks:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & $25-34$ & $35-44$ & $45-54$ & $55-64$ & $65-74$ & $75-84$ & $85-94$ \\
\hline
Frequency & 5 & 10 & 15 & 20 & 30 & 16 & 4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Solution: Here, the class interval is given, and that is why it is not possible to know the individual marks of the students. In such a case, it becomes necessary to know the mid-value of the class:
\[
\text{Mid-value of the class} = \frac{\text{Class upper value} + \text{Class lower value}}{2}
\]
If the class mid-value is $x_i (i=1, \ldots, k)$, the mid-value-related table will be:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & Class mid-value ($x_i$) & Frequency ($f_i$) & $f_i x_i$ \\
\hline
$25-34$ & 29.5 & 5 & 147.5 \\
$35-44$ & 39.5 & 10 & 395 \\
$45-54$ & 49.5 & 15 & 742.5 \\
$55-64$ & 59.5 & 20 & 1190 \\
$65-74$ & 69.5 & 30 & 2085 \\
$75-84$ & 79.5 & 16 & 1272 \\
$85-94$ & 89.5 & 4 & 358 \\
\hline
Total & & $n=100$ & 6190.0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The required arithmetic mean:
\[
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^k f_i x_i = \frac{1}{100} \times 6190 = 61.9
\]

% Defining the section for Arithmetic Mean of Classified Data (Short-cut Method)
\section*{Arithmetic Mean of Classified Data (Short-cut Method)}
The short-cut method is easy for determining the arithmetic mean of classified data. The steps to determine the mean by the short-cut method are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the mid-value of classes.
    \item Take a convenient approximated mean ($a$) from the mid-values.
    \item Determine step deviation; the difference between class mid-values and approximate mean is divided by the class interval, i.e.,
    \[
    \text{Step deviation } u = \frac{\text{Mid value} - \text{Approximate mean}}{\text{Class interval}}
    \]
    \item Multiply the step deviation by the corresponding class frequency.
    \item Determine the mean of the deviation and add this mean to the approximate mean to find the required mean.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Short-cut Method}
The formula used for determining the mean of the data by this method is:
\[
\bar{x} = a + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n f_i u_i}{n} \times h
\]
where $\bar{x}$ = required mean, $a$ = approximate mean, $f_i$ = class frequency of the $i$-th class, $u_i f_i$ = the product of step deviation with class intervals of the $i$-th class, $h$ = class interval, $k$ = number of classes, and $n$ = total number of frequencies.

\subsection*{Example 8}
The production cost (in hundred taka) of a commodity at different stages is shown in the following table. Find the mean of the expenditure by the short-cut method:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Production cost (in hundred taka) & $2-6$ & $6-10$ & $10-14$ & $14-18$ & $18-22$ & $22-26$ & $26-30$ & $30-34$ \\
\hline
Frequency & 1 & 9 & 21 & 47 & 52 & 36 & 19 & 3 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Solution: To determine the mean following the steps in the short-cut method, the table will be:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & Mid-value $x_i$ & Frequency $f_i$ & Step deviation $u_i = \frac{x_i - a}{h}$ & $f_i u_i$ \\
\hline
$2-6$ & 4 & 1 & $-4$ & $-4$ \\
$6-10$ & 8 & 9 & $-3$ & $-27$ \\
$10-14$ & 12 & 21 & $-2$ & $-42$ \\
$14-18$ & 16 & 47 & $-1$ & $-47$ \\
$18-22$ & $20 = a$ & 52 & 0 & 0 \\
$22-26$ & 24 & 36 & 1 & 36 \\
$26-30$ & 28 & 19 & 2 & 38 \\
$30-34$ & 32 & 3 & 3 & 9 \\
\hline
Total & & 188 & & $-37$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Mean:
\[
\bar{x} = a + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n f_i u_i}{n} \times h = 20 + \frac{-37}{188} \times 4 = 20 - 0.79 = 19.21
\]
Therefore, the mean production cost is Tk. 19 hundred.

% Defining the section for Weighted Mean
\section*{Weighted Mean}
In many cases, the numerical values $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ of statistical data under investigation may be influenced by different reasons/importance/weight. In such cases, the values of the data $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ along with their reasons/importance/weight $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ are considered to find the arithmetic mean. If the values of $n$ numbers of data are $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ and their weights are $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$, the weighted mean will be:
\[
\bar{x}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i w_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}
\]

\subsection*{Example 9}
The rate of passing in degree Honours class and the number of students of some departments of a university are presented in the table below. Find the mean rate of passing in degree Honours class of those departments of the university:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Name of the department & Math & Statistics & English & Bangla & Zoology & Political Science \\
\hline
Rate of passing (\%) & 70 & 80 & 50 & 90 & 60 & 85 \\
\hline
Number of students & 80 & 120 & 100 & 225 & 135 & 300 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Solution: Here, the rate of passing and the number of students are given. The weight of the rate of passing is the number of students. If the variables of the rate of passing are $x_i$ and the numerical variable of students is $w_i$, the table for determining the arithmetic mean of the given weight will be:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Department & Rate of passing $x_i$ & Number of students $w_i$ & $x_i w_i$ \\
\hline
Math & 70 & 80 & 5600 \\
Statistics & 80 & 120 & 9600 \\
English & 50 & 100 & 5000 \\
Bangla & 90 & 225 & 20250 \\
Zoology & 60 & 135 & 8100 \\
Political Science & 85 & 300 & 25500 \\
\hline
Total & & 960 & 74050 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\[
\bar{x}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^6 x_i w_i}{\sum_{i=1}^6 w_i} = \frac{74050}{960} = 77.14
\]
Therefore, the mean rate of passing is 77.14\%.

% Defining the section for Median
\section*{Median}
We have already learnt in class VIII that the value of the data which divides the data, when arranged in ascending order, into two equal parts is the median of the data. We have also learnt that if the number of data is $n$ and $n$ is an odd number, the median will be the value of the $\frac{n+1}{2}$th term. But if $n$ is an even number, the median will be the numerical mean of the value of the $\frac{n}{2}$th and $\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)$th terms. Here, we present through examples how the median is determined with or without the help of formulae.

\subsection*{Example 10}
The frequency distribution table of 51 students is placed below. Find the median:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Height (cm) & 150 & 155 & 160 & 165 & 170 & 175 \\
\hline
Frequency & 4 & 6 & 12 & 16 & 8 & 5 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Solution: The cumulative frequency distribution table for finding the median is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Height (cm) & Frequency & Cumulative Frequency \\
\hline
150 & 4 & 4 \\
155 & 6 & 10 \\
160 & 12 & 22 \\
165 & 16 & 38 \\
170 & 8 & 46 \\
175 & 5 & 51 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Here, $n = 51$ is an odd number. Therefore, the median is the value of the $\frac{51+1}{2}$th term = the value of the 26th term = 165. The required median is 165 cm.

Note: The value of the terms from the 23rd to the 38th is 165.

\subsection*{Example 11}
The frequency distribution table of marks obtained in mathematics of 60 students is as follows. Find the median:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Marks obtained & 40 & 45 & 50 & 55 & 60 & 70 & 80 & 85 & 90 & 95 & 100 \\
\hline
Frequency & 2 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 7 & 10 & 16 & 6 & 4 & 3 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Solution: The cumulative frequency distribution table for determining the median is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Marks obtained & Frequency & Cumulative Frequency \\
\hline
40 & 2 & 2 \\
45 & 4 & 6 \\
50 & 4 & 10 \\
55 & 3 & 13 \\
60 & 7 & 20 \\
70 & 10 & 30 \\
80 & 16 & 46 \\
85 & 6 & 52 \\
90 & 4 & 56 \\
95 & 3 & 59 \\
100 & 1 & 60 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Here, $n = 60$, which is an even number. Therefore:
\[
\text{Median} = \frac{\frac{60}{2}\text{th term} + \left(\frac{60}{2} + 1\right)\text{th term}}{2} = \frac{30\text{th term} + 31\text{th term}}{2} = \frac{70 + 80}{2} = 75
\]
The required median is 75.

% Defining the section for Determining Median of Classified Data
\section*{Determining Median of Classified Data}
If the number of classified data is $n$, the value of the $\frac{n}{2}$th term of classified data is the median. The formula used to determine the median or the value of the $\frac{n}{2}$th term is:
\[
\text{Median} = L + \left( \frac{\frac{n}{2} - F_c}{f_m} \right) \times h
\]
where $L$ is the lower limit of the median class, $n$ is the total frequency, $F_c$ is the cumulative frequency of the previous class to the median class, $f_m$ is the frequency of the median class, and $h$ is the class interval.

\subsection*{Example 12}
Determine the median from the following frequency distribution table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Time (sec.) & $30-35$ & $36-41$ & $42-47$ & $48-53$ & $54-59$ & $60-65$ \\
\hline
Frequency & 3 & 10 & 18 & 25 & 8 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

1) What is a frequency distribution table?
2) Determine the median from the frequency distribution table given above.
3) Draw the frequency polygon of the given data.

Solution:
1) A frequency distribution table refers to organizing and tabulating a dataset by determining specific class intervals and the number of classes.
2) The frequency distribution table to determine the median is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & Frequency & Cumulative frequency \\
\hline
$30-35$ & 3 & 3 \\
$36-41$ & 10 & 13 \\
$42-47$ & 18 & 31 \\
$48-53$ & 25 & 56 \\
$54-59$ & 8 & 64 \\
$60-65$ & 6 & 70 \\
\hline
& $n=70$ & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Here, $n = 70$ and $\frac{n}{2} = \frac{70}{2} = 35$. Therefore, the median is the value of the 35th term. The 35th term lies in the class $(48-53)$. Hence, the median class is $(48-53)$. Thus, $L = 48$, $F_c = 31$, $f_m = 25$, and $h = 6$. So:
\[
\text{Median} = 48 + (35 - 31) \times \frac{6}{25} = 48 + 4 \times \frac{6}{25} = 48 + 0.96 = 48.96
\]
The required median is 48.96.
3) The table useful to draw the frequency polygon is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & Mid-point & Frequency \\
\hline
$30-35$ & 32.5 & 3 \\
$36-41$ & 38.5 & 10 \\
$42-47$ & 44.5 & 18 \\
$48-53$ & 50.5 & 25 \\
$54-59$ & 56.5 & 8 \\
$60-65$ & 62.5 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The mid-point of the class prior to the first class is 26.5, and the mid-point of the class following the last class is 68.5. Taking a convenient unit for mid-point values along the x-axis, where the $\rightarrow/$ sign indicates $0-26.5$, and taking the length of the side of each square as 2 units of frequency along the y-axis, the frequency polygon has been drawn.

Image description: The figure shows a frequency polygon with mid-points (26.5, 32.5, 38.5, 44.5, 50.5, 56.5, 62.5, 68.5) on the x-axis and frequencies (0, 3, 10, 18, 25, 8, 6, 0) on the y-axis. The points are connected by line segments, forming a polygon that starts and ends on the x-axis.

% Defining the section for Mode
\section*{Mode}
In class VIII, we have learned that the number which appears the maximum number of times in a data set is the mode of the data. In a data set, there may be one or more than one mode. If there is no repetition of a member in a data set, the data will have no mode. Now, we shall discuss how to determine the mode of classified data using a formula.

% Defining the section for Determining Mode of Classified Data
\section*{Determining Mode of Classified Data}
\[
\text{Mode} = L + \frac{f_1}{f_1 + f_2} \times h
\]
where $L$ is the lower limit of the mode class, i.e., the class where the mode lies, $f_1 = \text{frequency of mode class} - \text{frequency of the previous class}$, $f_2 = \text{frequency of mode class} - \text{frequency of the next class}$, and $h = \text{class interval}$.

\subsection*{Example 13}
The following is a table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & $31-40$ & $41-50$ & $51-60$ & $61-70$ & $71-80$ & $81-90$ & $91-100$ \\
\hline
Frequency & 4 & 6 & 8 & 12 & 9 & 7 & 4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

1) What is central tendency?
2) Find the mode from the above table.
3) Draw the ogive curve of the given data.

Solution:
1) If the disorganized data of statistics are arranged according to the value, the data cluster around a central value. Moreover, an abundance of data is observed in a single class when these data are presented in a frequency distribution table. This tendency of data to cluster around a central value is known as central tendency.
2) The table to determine the mode is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & $31-40$ & $41-50$ & $51-60$ & $61-70$ & $71-80$ & $81-90$ & $91-100$ \\
\hline
Frequency & 4 & 6 & 8 & 12 & 9 & 7 & 4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\[
\text{Mode} = L + \frac{f_1}{f_1 + f_2} \times h
\]
Here, the maximum number of repetitions of frequency is 12, which lies in the class $(61-70)$. Thus, $L = 61$, $f_1 = 12 - 8 = 4$, $f_2 = 12 - 9 = 3$, $h = 10$. Therefore:
\[
\text{Mode} = 61 + \frac{4}{4 + 3} \times 10 = 61 + \frac{4}{7} \times 10 = 61 + \frac{40}{7} = 61 + 5.7 = 66.7
\]
The required mode is 66.7.
3) The table to draw the ogive curve is:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & Discontinuous class interval & Frequency & Cumulative frequency \\
\hline
$31-40$ & $30-40$ & 4 & 4 \\
$41-50$ & $40-50$ & 6 & 10 \\
$51-60$ & $50-60$ & 8 & 18 \\
$61-70$ & $60-70$ & 12 & 30 \\
$71-80$ & $70-80$ & 9 & 39 \\
$81-90$ & $80-90$ & 7 & 46 \\
$91-100$ & $90-100$ & 4 & 50 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Using convenient scaling along the x-axis, where the $\rightarrow/$ sign indicates $0-30$, and taking each square unit as 5 units of cumulative frequency along the y-axis, points along the higher limits of classes have been marked. Then, these marked points have been joined to draw the ogive curve.

Image description: The figure shows an ogive curve with upper class limits (40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100) on the x-axis and cumulative frequencies (4, 10, 18, 30, 39, 46, 50) on the y-axis. The points are connected by smooth line segments, forming a curve starting from approximately 30 on the x-axis.

\subsection*{Example 14}
Find the mode from the frequency distribution table given below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & $41-50$ & $51-60$ & $61-70$ & $71-80$ \\
\hline
Frequency & 25 & 20 & 15 & 8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Solution: Here, the maximum number of frequencies is 25, which lies in the class $(41-50)$. So, it is evident that the mode is in this class. We know that:
\[
\text{Mode} = L + \frac{f_1}{f_1 + f_2} \times h
\]
Here, $L = 41$, $f_1 = 25 - 0 = 25$ (if the frequency is maximum in the first class, the frequency of the previous class is zero), $f_2 = 25 - 20 = 5$, $h = 10$. Therefore:
\[
\text{Mode} = 41 + \frac{25}{25 + 5} \times 10 = 41 + \frac{25}{30} \times 10 = 41 + 8.33 = 49.33
\]
The required mode is 49.33.

\subsection*{Example 15}
Find the mode from the frequency distribution table given below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Class interval & $11-20$ & $21-30$ & $31-40$ & $41-50$ \\
\hline
Frequency & 4 & 16 & 20 & 25 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Solution: The maximum number of frequencies is 25, which lies in the class $(41-50)$. So, it is obvious that this class is the class of the mode. We know that:
\[
\text{Mode} = L + \frac{f_1}{f_1 + f_2} \times h
\]
Here, $L = 41$, $f_1 = 25 - 20 = 5$, $f_2 = 25 - 0 = 25$ (if the frequency is maximum in the last class, the frequency of the following class is zero), $h = 10$. Therefore:
\[
\text{Mode} = 41 + \frac{5}{25 + 5} \times 10 = 41 + \frac{5}{30} \times 10 = 41 + \frac{5}{3} = 41 + 1.67 = 42.67
\]
The required mode is 42.67 (approximately).

If the frequency is maximum in at the first class, the frequency of the previous class is zero. If the frequency is maximum in the last class, the frequency of the following class is zero.
