\section*{Introduction}
We know that bounded plane figures may have different shapes. If the region is bounded by four sides, it is known as a quadrilateral. Quadrilaterals have classification and they are also named based on their shapes and properties. Apart from these, there are many regions bounded by more than four sides. These are polygonal regions or simply polygons. Every closed region has a certain measurement which is called the area of the region. For measurement of areas, usually the area of a square with sides of 1 unit of length is used as the unit area and their areas are expressed in square units. For example, the area of Bangladesh is 1.47 lacs square kilometers (approximately). In our day-to-day life, we need to know and measure areas of polygons for meeting the necessity of life. So, it is important for the learners to have a comprehensive knowledge about areas of polygons. Areas of polygons and related theorems and constructions are presented here.

At the end of the chapter, the students will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain the area of polygons.
    \item Verify and prove theorems related to areas.
    \item Construct polygons and justify construction by using given data.
    \item Construct a quadrilateral with area equal to the area of a triangle.
    \item Construct a triangle with area equal to the area of a quadrilateral.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Area of a Plane Region}
Every closed plane region has a definite area. In order to measure such area, usually the area of a square having sides of unit length is taken as the unit. For example, the area of a square with a side of length $1 \, \text{cm}$ is 1 square centimeter.

We know that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If the length of the rectangular region $ABCD$, $AB = a$ units (say, meter), breadth $BC = b$ units (say, meter), the area of the region $ABCD = ab$ square units (say, square meters).
    \item If the length of a side of the square region $ABCD$, $AB = a$ units (say, meter), the area of the region $ABCD = a^2$ square units (say, square meters).
\end{enumerate}

When the areas of two regions are equal, the sign `$=$' is used between them. For example, the area of the rectangular region $ABCD =$ area of the triangular region $AED$, where $AB = BE$.

It should be mentioned that, if $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ are congruent, we write $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$. In this case, the area of the triangular region $\triangle ABC =$ area of the triangular region $\triangle DEF$.

However, two triangles are not necessarily congruent when they have equal areas. For example, the area of $\triangle ABC =$ area of $\triangle DBC$, but $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DBC$ are not congruent.

\section*{Theorems on Areas}

\subsection*{Theorem 36}
The areas of all triangular regions having the same base and lying between the same pair of parallel lines are equal to one another.

Let the triangular regions $ABC$ and $DBC$ stand on the same base $BC$ and lie between the pair of parallel lines $BC$ and $AD$. It is required to prove that the area of $\triangle ABC =$ area of $\triangle DBC$.

\textbf{Drawing:} At the points $B$ and $C$ of the line segment $BC$, draw perpendiculars $BE$ and $CF$ respectively. They intersect the line $AD$ or extended $AD$ at the points $E$ and $F$ respectively. As a result, a rectangular region $EBCF$ is formed.

\textbf{Proof:} According to the construction, $EBCF$ is a rectangular region. In triangle $ABC$, the base and height are $BC$ and $BE$ respectively. Hence,
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times BE \quad (1)
\]
In triangle $DBC$, the base and height are $BC$ and $CF$ respectively. Therefore,
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle DBC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times CF = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times BE \quad (2)
\]
[Since $EBCF$ is a rectangle, $CF = BE$.] Comparing (1) and (2),
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \text{Area of } \triangle DBC \quad (\text{proved})
\]

\textbf{Corollary 1:} If the areas of triangular regions lying on the same base and same side are equal, the triangles lie between the same pair of parallel lines.

\textbf{Corollary 2:} The area of a triangle is exactly half of the area of a parallelogram lying on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines.

\textbf{Hints:} In the figure, $ABCD$ is a parallelogram with $AC$ as diagonal. Therefore,
\[
\triangle ABC \cong \triangle ADC
\]
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Area of parallelogram } ABCD
\]

\subsection*{Theorem 37}
Parallelograms lying on the same base and between the same pair of parallel lines are of equal area.

Let the parallelogram regions $ABCD$ and $ABEF$ stand on the same base $AB$ and lie between the pair of parallel lines $AB$ and $FC$. It is required to prove that the area of the parallelogram $ABCD =$ area of the parallelogram $ABEF$.

\textbf{Drawing:} Join $A, C$ and $A, E$. From the points $C$ and $E$, draw perpendiculars $EK$ and $CL$ to the base $AB$ and extended $AB$ respectively.

\textbf{Proof:} The area of $\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times CL$ and the area of $\triangle ABE = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times EK$. Since $CL = EK$ (by construction, $AL \parallel FC$),
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \text{Area of } \triangle ABE
\]
\[
\implies \frac{1}{2} \text{ area of the parallelogram } ABCD = \frac{1}{2} \text{ area of the parallelogram } ABEF
\]
\[
\therefore \text{Area of the parallelogram } ABCD = \text{Area of the parallelogram } ABEF \quad (\text{proved})
\]

\subsection*{Theorem 38: Pythagoras Theorem}
In a right-angled triangle, the area of the square drawn on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares drawn on the other two sides.

Let $ABC$ be a right-angled triangle in which $\angle ACB$ is a right angle and the hypotenuse is $AB$. It is to be proved that:
\[
AB^2 = BC^2 + AC^2
\]

\textbf{Drawing:} Draw three squares $ABED$, $ACGF$, and $BCHK$ on the external sides of $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$ respectively. Through $C$, draw the line segment $CL$ parallel to $AD$ or $BE$. Let $CL$ intersect $AB$ at $M$ and $DE$ at $L$ respectively. Join $C, D$ and $B, F$.

\textbf{Proof:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In $\triangle CAD$ and $\triangle BAF$, $CA = AF$, $AD = AB$, and included $\angle CAD = \angle CAB + \angle BAD = \angle CAB + \angle CAF = \angle BAF$ [since $\angle BAD = \angle CAF = 1$ right angle]. Therefore,
    \[
    \triangle CAD \cong \triangle BAF
    \]
    \item Triangle $\triangle CAD$ and rectangular region $ADLM$ lie on the same base $AD$ and between the parallel lines $AD$ and $CL$. Therefore,
    \[
    \text{Rectangular region } ADLM = 2 \triangle CAD \quad [\text{Theorem 37}]
    \]
    \item $\triangle BAF$ and the square $ACGF$ lie on the same base $AF$ and between the parallel lines $AF$ and $BG$. Hence,
    \[
    \text{Square region } ACGF = 2 \triangle FAB = 2 \triangle CAD \quad [\text{Theorem 37}]
    \]
    \item Rectangular region $ADLM = \text{square region } ACGF$.
    \item Similarly, joining $C, E$ and $A, K$, it can be proved that rectangular region $BELM = \text{square region } BCHK$.
    \item Rectangular region $(ADLM + BELM) = \text{square region } ACGF + \text{square region } BCHK$, or,
    \[
    \text{Square region } ABED = \text{square region } ACGF + \text{square region } BCHK
    \]
    That is,
    \[
    AB^2 = BC^2 + AC^2 \quad (\text{proved})
    \]
\end{enumerate}

\part{Constructions}
% Defining the section for Constructions
\section*{Constructions}

\subsection*{Construction 13}
Construct a parallelogram with an angle equal to a definite angle and area equal to that of a triangular region.

Let $ABC$ be a triangular region and $\angle x$ be a definite angle. It is required to construct a parallelogram with an angle equal to $\angle x$ and area equal to the area of the triangular region $ABC$.

\textbf{Drawing:} Bisect the line segment $BC$ at $E$. At the point $E$ of the line segment $EC$, draw $\angle CEF$ equal to $\angle x$. Through $A$, draw $AG$ parallel to $BC$, which intersects the ray $EF$ at $F$. Again, through $C$, draw the ray $CG$ parallel to $EF$, which intersects the ray $AG$ at $G$. Hence, $ECGF$ is the required parallelogram.

\textbf{Proof:} Join $A, E$. Now,
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABE = \text{Area of } \triangle AEC \quad [\text{since base } BE = \text{base } EC \text{ and heights of both triangles are equal}]
\]
\[
\therefore \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = 2 (\text{Area of } \triangle AEC)
\]
Again,
\[
\text{Area of the parallelogram } ECGF = 2 (\text{Area of } \triangle AEC) \quad [\text{since both lie on the same base } EC \text{ and } EC \parallel AG]
\]
\[
\therefore \text{Area of the parallelogram } ECGF = \text{Area of } \triangle ABC
\]
Also, $\angle CEF = \angle x$ [since $EF \parallel CB$ by construction]. Thus, the parallelogram $ECGF$ is the required parallelogram.

\subsection*{Construction 14}
Construct a triangle with the area of the triangular region equal to that of a quadrilateral region.

Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral region. It is required to construct a triangle such that the area of the triangular region is equal to that of the quadrilateral region $ABCD$.

\textbf{Drawing:} Join $D, B$. Through $C$, draw $CE$ parallel to $DB$, which intersects the side $AB$ extended at $E$. Join $D, E$. Then, $\triangle DAE$ is the required triangle.

\textbf{Proof:} $\triangle BDC$ and $\triangle BDE$ lie on the same base $BD$ and $CE \parallel DB$ (by construction). Therefore,
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle BDC = \text{Area of } \triangle BDE
\]
\[
\therefore \text{Area of } \triangle BDC + \text{Area of } \triangle ABD = \text{Area of } \triangle BDE + \text{Area of } \triangle ABD
\]
\[
\therefore \text{Area of the quadrilateral region } ABCD = \text{Area of } \triangle ADE
\]
Therefore, $\triangle DAE$ is the required triangle.

\textbf{Nota Bene:} Applying the above-mentioned method, innumerable numbers of triangles can be drawn whose area is equal to the area of a given quadrilateral region.

\subsection*{Construction 15}
Construct a parallelogram with a given angle and the area of the bounded region equal to that of a quadrilateral region.

Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral region and $\angle x$ be a definite angle. It is required to construct a parallelogram with angle $\angle x$ and the area equal to the area of the quadrilateral region $ABCD$.

\textbf{Drawing:} Join $B, D$. Through $C$, draw $CF$ parallel to $DB$, which intersects the side $AB$ extended at $F$. Find the midpoint $G$ of the line segment $AF$. At $A$ of the line segment $AG$, draw $\angle GAK$ equal to $\angle x$ and draw $AK \parallel GH$ through $G$. Again, draw $KDH \parallel AG$ through $D$ and let $KDH$ intersect $AK$ and $GH$ at $K$ and $H$ respectively. Hence, $AGHK$ is the required parallelogram.

\textbf{Proof:} Join $D, F$. By construction, $AGHK$ is a parallelogram, where $\angle GAK = \angle x$. Again, the area of $\triangle DAF = \text{area of the quadrilateral region } ABCD$ and the area of the parallelogram $AGHK = \text{area of the triangular region } DAF$. Therefore, $AGHK$ is the required parallelogram.
