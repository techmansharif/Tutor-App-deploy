\section*{Introduction}
The length of a line, the area of a place, the volume of a solid, etc., are determined for practical purposes. In the case of measuring any such quantity, another quantity of the same kind having some definite magnitude is taken as a unit. The ratio of the quantity measured and the unit defined in the above process is the amount of the quantity, i.e.,
\[
\text{magnitude} = \frac{\text{Quantity measured}}{\text{Unit quantity}}
\]
In the case of a fixed unit, every measure is a number which denotes how many times the magnitude of the unit is the magnitude of the quantity measured. For example, if a bench is 5 meters long, the meter is a definite length taken as a unit, and in comparison, the bench is 5 times in length.

\part{Area of Triangular Region}
% Defining the section for Area of Triangular Region
\section*{Area of Triangular Region}
In the previous class, we learned that the area of a triangular region is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

\subsection*{1. Right-angled Triangle}
Let in the right-angled triangle $ABC$, $BC = a$ and $AB = b$ be the adjacent sides of the right angle. If we consider $BC$ as the base and $AB$ as the height, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} a b
\]

Image description: The figure shows a right-angled triangle $ABC$ with the right angle at $B$. The sides $BC = a$ and $AB = b$ are adjacent to the right angle, with $BC$ as the base and $AB$ as the height.

\subsection*{2. Two Sides and the Included Angle}
Let in $\triangle ABC$, the sides be $BC = a$, $CA = b$, $AB = c$. Draw $AD$ perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$. Let the altitude (height) $AD = h$. Considering angle $C$, we get:
\[
\frac{AD}{CA} = \sin C \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{h}{b} = \sin C \quad \text{or} \quad h = b \sin C
\]
Thus, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} BC \times AD = \frac{1}{2} a \times b \sin C = \frac{1}{2} a b \sin C
\]
Similarly:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} b c \sin A = \frac{1}{2} c a \sin B
\]

Image description: The figure depicts a triangle $ABC$ with sides $BC = a$, $CA = b$, and $AB = c$. A perpendicular $AD$ is drawn from vertex $A$ to side $BC$, with $AD = h$ as the height and angle $C$ at vertex $C$ used to derive the area formula.

\subsection*{3. Three Sides of a Triangle}
Let in $\triangle ABC$, $BC = a$, $CA = b$, and $AB = c$. The perimeter of the triangle is $2s = a + b + c$, so $s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}$. Draw $AD \perp BC$. Let $BD = x$, then $CD = a - x$. In right-angled triangles $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle ACD$:
\[
AD^2 = AB^2 - BD^2 \quad \text{and} \quad AD^2 = AC^2 - CD^2
\]
Thus:
\[
AB^2 - BD^2 = AC^2 - CD^2
\]
\[
c^2 - x^2 = b^2 - (a - x)^2
\]
\[
c^2 - x^2 = b^2 - a^2 + 2ax - x^2
\]
\[
2ax = c^2 + a^2 - b^2
\]
\[
x = \frac{c^2 + a^2 - b^2}{2a}
\]
Further:
\[
AD^2 = c^2 - x^2 = c^2 - \left( \frac{c^2 + a^2 - b^2}{2a} \right)^2
\]
\[
= \left( c + \frac{c^2 + a^2 - b^2}{2a} \right) \left( c - \frac{c^2 + a^2 - b^2}{2a} \right)
\]
\[
= \frac{(2ac + c^2 + a^2 - b^2)(2ac - c^2 - a^2 + b^2)}{4a^2}
\]
\[
= \frac{[(c + a)^2 - b^2][b^2 - (c - a)^2]}{4a^2}
\]
\[
= \frac{(c + a + b)(c + a - b)(b + c - a)(b - c + a)}{4a^2}
\]
\[
= \frac{(a + b + c)(a + b + c - 2b)(a + b + c - 2a)(a + b + c - 2c)}{4a^2}
\]
\[
= \frac{2s (2s - 2b)(2s - 2a)(2s - 2c)}{4a^2}
\]
\[
= \frac{4s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}{4a^2}
\]
\[
AD = \frac{2}{a} \sqrt{s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
\]
Thus, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} BC \cdot AD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot \frac{2}{a} \sqrt{s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} = \sqrt{s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)}
\]

Image description: The figure illustrates a triangle $ABC$ with sides $BC = a$, $CA = b$, and $AB = c$. A perpendicular $AD$ is drawn from $A$ to $BC$, dividing $BC$ into segments $BD = x$ and $CD = a - x$, used to derive Heron's formula for the area.

\subsection*{4. Equilateral Triangle}
Let each side of the equilateral triangle $ABC$ be $a$. Draw $AD \perp BC$, so $BD = CD = \frac{a}{2}$. In right-angled $\triangle ABD$:
\[
BD^2 + AD^2 = AB^2
\]
\[
AD^2 = a^2 - \left( \frac{a}{2} \right)^2 = a^2 - \frac{a^2}{4} = \frac{3a^2}{4}
\]
\[
AD = \frac{\sqrt{3} a}{2}
\]
Thus, the area of $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot AD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} a}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2
\]

Image description: The figure shows an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with all sides equal to $a$. A perpendicular $AD$ is drawn from vertex $A$ to side $BC$, bisecting $BC$ into two equal segments $BD = CD = \frac{a}{2}$, with $AD$ as the height.

\subsection*{5. Isosceles Triangle}
Let $ABC$ be an isosceles triangle with $AB = AC = a$ and $BC = b$. Draw $AD \perp BC$, so $BD = CD = \frac{b}{2}$. In right-angled $\triangle ABD$:
\[
AD^2 = AB^2 - BD^2 = a^2 - \left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 = a^2 - \frac{b^2}{4} = \frac{4a^2 - b^2}{4}
\]
\[
AD = \frac{\sqrt{4a^2 - b^2}}{2}
\]
Thus, the area of isosceles $\triangle ABC$ is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot AD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot \frac{\sqrt{4a^2 - b^2}}{2} = \frac{b}{4} \sqrt{4a^2 - b^2}
\]

Image description: The figure depicts an isosceles triangle $ABC$ with equal sides $AB = AC = a$ and base $BC = b$. A perpendicular $AD$ is drawn from $A$ to $BC$, bisecting $BC$ into $BD = CD = \frac{b}{2}$, with $AD$ as the height.

% Defining examples for triangular regions
\subsection*{Example 1}
The lengths of the two sides of a right-angled triangle, adjacent to the right angle, are 6 cm and 8 cm respectively. Find the area of the triangle.

Solution: Let the sides adjacent to the right angle be $a = 8$ cm and $b = 6$ cm. The area is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} a b = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 8 = 24 \, \text{square cm}
\]

\subsection*{Example 2}
The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 9 cm and 10 cm respectively, and the angle included between them is $60^\circ$. Find the area.

Solution: Let the sides be $a = 9$ cm and $b = 10$ cm, with included angle $\theta = 60^\circ$. The area is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} a b \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times 10 \times \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \times 90 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 38.97 \, \text{sq cm (approx.)}
\]

Image description: The figure shows a triangle with two sides of lengths 9 cm and 10 cm, and the angle between them is $60^\circ$, used to calculate the area using the formula involving the sine of the included angle.

\subsection*{Example 3}
The lengths of the three sides of a triangle are 7 cm, 8 cm, and 9 cm respectively. Find its area.

Solution: Let the sides be $a = 7$ cm, $b = 8$ cm, $c = 9$ cm. The semi-perimeter is:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{7 + 8 + 9}{2} = 12 \, \text{cm}
\]
The area is:
\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)} = \sqrt{12 (12 - 7)(12 - 8)(12 - 9)} = \sqrt{12 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3} = \sqrt{720} = 26.83 \, \text{sq cm (approx.)}
\]

\subsection*{Example 4}
The area of an equilateral triangle increases by $3\sqrt{3}$ sq. meter when the length of each side increases by 1 meter. Find the length of the side of the triangle.

Solution: Let the side length be $a$ meters. The area is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2$ sq. meters. When the side increases to $a + 1$, the area becomes:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (a + 1)^2
\]
Given:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (a + 1)^2 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 = 3 \sqrt{3}
\]
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} [(a + 1)^2 - a^2] = 3 \sqrt{3}
\]
\[
(a + 1)^2 - a^2 = 12
\]
\[
a^2 + 2a + 1 - a^2 = 12
\]
\[
2a + 1 = 12
\]
\[
2a = 11
\]
\[
a = 5.5
\]
The side length is 5.5 meters.

\subsection*{Example 5}
The length of the base of an isosceles triangle is 60 cm. If its area is 1200 sq. cm, find the length of the equal sides.

Solution: Let the base $b = 60$ cm and the equal sides be $a$ cm. The area is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{b}{4} \sqrt{4a^2 - b^2}
\]
Given:
\[
\frac{60}{4} \sqrt{4a^2 - 60^2} = 1200
\]
\[
15 \sqrt{4a^2 - 3600} = 1200
\]
\[
\sqrt{4a^2 - 3600} = 80
\]
\[
4a^2 - 3600 = 6400
\]
\[
4a^2 = 10000
\]
\[
a^2 = 2500
\]
\[
a = 50
\]
The length of the equal sides is 50 cm.

\subsection*{Example 6}
From a certain place, two roads run in two directions making an angle of $120^\circ$. Two persons move in these directions with speeds of 10 km/h and 8 km/h respectively. What will be the direct distance between them after 5 hours?

Solution: Let the persons start from point $A$, reaching points $B$ and $C$ after 5 hours. Distances are:
\[
AB = 5 \times 10 = 50 \, \text{km}, \quad AC = 5 \times 8 = 40 \, \text{km}, \quad \angle BAC = 120^\circ
\]
Draw perpendicular $CD$ from $C$ to $BA$ extended. Thus, $\angle DAC = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$. In right-angled $\triangle ACD$:
\[
\frac{CD}{AC} = \sin 60^\circ \quad \text{or} \quad CD = 40 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 20 \sqrt{3}
\]
\[
\frac{AD}{AC} = \cos 60^\circ \quad \text{or} \quad AD = 40 \times \frac{1}{2} = 20
\]
In right-angled $\triangle BCD$:
\[
BD = BA + AD = 50 + 20 = 70
\]
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 = 70^2 + (20 \sqrt{3})^2 = 4900 + 1200 = 6100
\]
\[
BC = \sqrt{6100} = 78.1 \, \text{km (approx.)}
\]
The distance is 78.1 km (approx.).

Image description: The figure shows a point $A$ from which two paths diverge at a $120^\circ$ angle. After 5 hours, one person is at point $B$ (50 km from $A$) and another at point $C$ (40 km from $A$). A perpendicular $CD$ is drawn from $C$ to the extended line $BA$, forming a right-angled triangle $BCD$.

\subsection*{Example 7}
Consider the diagram and:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the length of side $BC$.
    \item Find the value of $BD$.
    \item Find the ratio of areas of $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle BCD$.
\end{enumerate}

Solution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given $AB = 15$, $AC = 25$. In right-angled $\triangle ABC$:
    \[
    BC = \sqrt{AC^2 - AB^2} = \sqrt{25^2 - 15^2} = \sqrt{400} = 20
    \]
    \item Area of $\triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} BC \cdot AB = \frac{1}{2} AC \cdot BD$:
    \[
    \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times 15 = \frac{1}{2} \times 25 \times BD
    \]
    \[
    25 \times BD = 20 \times 15
    \]
    \[
    BD = 12
    \]
    \item In $\triangle ABD$:
    \[
    AD^2 + BD^2 = AB^2
    \]
    \[
    AD^2 + 12^2 = 15^2
    \]
    \[
    AD^2 = 225 - 144 = 81
    \]
    \[
    AD = 9
    \]
    \[
    CD = AC - AD = 25 - 9 = 16
    \]
    Ratio of areas:
    \[
    \frac{\triangle ABD}{\triangle BCD} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} BD \cdot AD}{\frac{1}{2} BD \cdot CD} = \frac{AD}{CD} = \frac{9}{16}
    \]
    Thus, $\triangle ABD : \triangle BCD = 9 : 16$.
\end{enumerate}

Image description: The diagram shows a right-angled triangle $ABC$ with a perpendicular $BD$ from $B$ to $AC$, dividing $\triangle ABC$ into two smaller triangles, $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle BCD$. The lengths $AB = 15$ and $AC = 25$ are indicated, and $BC$ is calculated to be 20.

\]

Image description: The figure shows a parallelogram $ABCD$ with base $AB = b$. A perpendicular $DE = h$ is drawn from $D$ to $AB$ (or its extension) for the base-height method, and diagonal $AC = d$ with perpendicular $DE = h$ from $D$ for the diagonal method.

\subsection*{4. Rhombus Region}
Let diagonals of rhombus $ABCD$ be $AC = d_1$, $BD = d_2$, intersecting at $O$. The diagonals bisect at right angles. Height of $\triangle ACD$ is $\frac{d_2}{2}$. The area is:

\]
\[

\]

Image description: The figure shows a trapezium $ABCD$ with parallel sides $AB = a$ and $CD = b$. Perpendiculars $CE = h$ and $AF = h$ are drawn from $C$ and $A$ to the opposite parallel sides, defining the height $h$.

\subsection*{Example 8}
The length of a rectangular room is $\frac{3}{2}$ times its breadth. If the area is 384 square meters, find the perimeter and length of the diagonal.

Solution: Let the breadth be $x$ meters. The length is $\frac{3}{2} x$. The area is:
\[
\frac{3}{2} x \cdot x = \frac{3}{2} x^2 = 384
\]
\[
3 x^2 = 768
\]
\[
x^2 = 256
\]
\[
x = 16
\]
Length = $\frac{3}{2} \times 16 = 24$ meters, breadth = 16 meters. Perimeter:
\[
2(24 + 16) = 80 \, \text{meters}
\]
Diagonal:
\[
\sqrt{24^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{576 + 256} = \sqrt{832} = 28.84 \, \text{meters (approx.)}
\]

\subsection*{Example 9}
The area of a rectangular region is 2000 square meters. If the length is reduced by 10 meters, it becomes a square region. Find the length and breadth.

Solution: Let length be $x$ meters and breadth $y$ meters. Given:
\[
x y = 2000
\]
\[
x - 10 = y
\]
Substitute $y = x - 10$:
\[
x (x - 10) = 2000
\]
\[
x^2 - 10 x - 2000 = 0
\]
\[
x = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{100 + 8000}}{2} = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{8100}}{2} = \frac{10 \pm 90}{2}
\]
\[
x = 50 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -40
\]
Since length is positive, $x = 50$. Then:
\[
y = 50 - 10 = 40
\]
Length is 50 meters, breadth is 40 meters.

x^2 - (x - 8)^2 = 10000 \, \text{(1 hectare = 10000 sq. meters)}
\]
\[
x^2 - (x^2 - 16x + 64) = 10000
\]
\[
16x - 64 = 10000
\]
\[
16x = 10064
\]
\[
x = 629
\]
Area excluding the road:

\]
Area of $\triangle ABD$:
\[
\sqrt{15 (15 - 12)(15 - 10)(15 - 8)} = \sqrt{15 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7} = \sqrt{1575} = 39.68 \, \text{sq. m (approx.)}
\]
Area of $\triangle ABD = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times DF$:
\[
39.68 = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times DF
\]
\[
DF = 6.61 \, \text{m (approx.)}
\]
In right-angled triangle $BCE$:
\[

\subsection*{Example 14}
The lengths of two parallel sides of a trapezium are 91 cm and 51 cm, and the other sides are 37 cm and 13 cm. Determine the area.

Solution: In trapezium $ABCD$, $AB = 91$ cm, $CD = 51$ cm. Draw perpendiculars $DF$ and $CF$. Rectangle $CDEF$ has $EF = CD = 51$ cm. Let $AE = x$, $DE = CF = h$. In $\triangle ADE$:

\]
In $\triangle BCF$:
\[
BF = 91 - (x + 51) = 40 - x
\]
\[
(40 - x)^2 + h^2 = 37^2 = 1369
\]
\[
1600 - 80x + x^2 + h^2 = 1369

% Defining the section for Area of Regular Polygon
\section*{Area of Regular Polygon}
A regular polygon has equal sides and angles. For a polygon with $n$ sides of length $a$, joining the center $O$ to vertices forms $n$ isosceles triangles. In $\triangle AOB$, let height $ON = h$, $\angle OAB = \theta$. The angle at each vertex is $2\theta$. Total angle at the center = $360^\circ$. Sum of angles in $n$ triangles:
\[
2\theta n + 4 \text{ right angles} = 2n \text{ right angles}
\]
\[
2\theta n = 2n - 4
\]
\[
\theta = \left(1 - \frac{2}{n}\right) \times 90^\circ = 90^\circ - \frac{180^\circ}{n}
\]
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{ON}{AN} = \frac{h}{\frac{a}{2}} = \frac{2h}{a}
\]
\[
h = \frac{a}{2} \tan \theta
\]
Area of $\triangle AOB$:
\[
\frac{1}{2} a h = \frac{1}{2} a \cdot \frac{a}{2} \tan \theta = \frac{a^2}{4} \cot \frac{180^\circ}{n}
\]
Total area:
\[
