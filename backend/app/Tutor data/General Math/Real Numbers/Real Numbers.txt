\section*{History of Numbers}

% Describing the historical context
History of numbers is as old as that of human civilization. Mathematics originated from the process of expressing quantity by symbols as numbers. According to Greek Philosopher Aristotle, the formal beginning of mathematics started with its practice among ancient Egyptian priests. It can be said that number-based mathematics was created about two thousand years before the birth of Jesus Christ. After that, numbers and operations on them have reached today's universal form through the hands of different nations and civilizations. Indian mathematicians introduced the concept of zero and the decimal number system to satisfy the need for counting natural numbers, considered a milestone in number representation. Later, Indian and Chinese mathematicians expanded the concepts of zero, negative, real, integer, and fractional numbers, which Arabian mathematicians built upon in the medieval age. Muslim mathematicians of the Middle East are credited with expressing numbers by decimal fractions and introducing irrational numbers in the form of square roots for solving quadratic algebraic equations in the 11th century. Historians believe that around 500 A.D., Greek philosophers recognized the necessity of irrational numbers, especially the square root of 2, for geometrical drawing. In the nineteenth century, European mathematicians systematized real numbers, giving them their complete shape. To meet daily needs, students require a clear understanding of real numbers, which are discussed in detail in this chapter.

\part{Classification of Numbers}
\section*{Classification of Real Numbers}

% Defining natural numbers
\textbf{Natural Number:} The numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$ are natural numbers or positive whole numbers. Numbers like $2, 3, 5, 7, \ldots$ are primes, and $4, 6, 8, 9, \ldots$ are composite numbers. If the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers is 1, they are called mutually prime. For example, 6 and 35 are mutually prime.

% Defining integers
\textbf{Integer:} All positive and negative fractionless numbers are integers. For example, $\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ are integers.

% Defining fractional numbers
\textbf{Fractional Number:} Numbers expressible as $\frac{p}{q}$ are fractional numbers, where $q \neq 0$, $q \neq 1$, and $p$ is not divisible by $q$. For example, $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{-5}{3}, \frac{4}{6}$ are simple fractional numbers. In a simple fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, if $p < q$, it is a proper fraction; if $p > q$, it is an improper fraction. Examples of proper fractions include $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \ldots$, and improper fractions include $\frac{3}{2}, \frac{4}{3}, \frac{5}{3}, \frac{5}{4}, \ldots$.

% Defining rational numbers
\textbf{Rational Number:} Numbers of the form $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$, are rational. For example, $\frac{3}{1} = 3$, $\frac{11}{2} = 5.5$, $\frac{5}{3} = 1.666\ldots$ are rational numbers. Any rational number can be expressed as a ratio of two mutually prime numbers. All integers and fractions are rational numbers.

% Defining irrational numbers
\textbf{Irrational Number:} A number that cannot be expressed as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$, is irrational. The square root of a natural number that is not a perfect square, or its fraction, is irrational. For example, $\sqrt{2} = 1.414213\ldots$, $\sqrt{3} = 1.732\ldots$, $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.118\ldots$ are irrational numbers. No irrational number can be expressed as a ratio of two integers.

% Defining decimal fractional numbers
\textbf{Decimal Fractional Number:} Rational and irrational numbers expressed using a decimal sign are decimal fractional numbers. For example, $3 = 3.0$, $\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$, $\frac{10}{3} = 3.3333\ldots$, $\sqrt{3} = 1.732\ldots$ are decimal fractional numbers. If there are a finite number of digits after the decimal point, it is a finite decimal fraction; if there are infinitely many digits, it is an infinite decimal fraction. Examples of finite decimal fractions include $0.52$, $3.4152$, while infinite decimal fractions include $\frac{4}{3} = 1.333\ldots$, $\sqrt{5} = 2.123512367\ldots$. Infinite decimal numbers with repeating digits after the decimal point are called infinite repeated decimal fractions, while those without repetition are infinite decimal numbers without repetition. For example, $\frac{122}{99} = 1.2323\ldots$, $5.1654\ldots$ are infinite repeated decimal fractions, and $0.523050056\ldots$, $2.12340314\ldots$ are infinite decimal numbers without repetition.

% Defining real numbers
\textbf{Real Number:} All rational and irrational numbers are real numbers. For example:
\[
\begin{aligned}
& 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \cdots \\
& \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{7}, \cdots \\
& 1.23, 0.415, 1.3333\ldots, 0.62, 4.120345061\ldots
\end{aligned}
\]

% Defining positive numbers
\textbf{Positive Number:} All real numbers greater than 0 are positive numbers. For example, $2$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{3}{2}$, $\sqrt{2}$, $0.415$, $0.62$, $4.120345061\ldots$ are positive numbers.

% Defining negative numbers
\textbf{Negative Number:} All real numbers less than 0 are negative numbers. For example, $-2$, $-\frac{1}{2}$, $-\frac{3}{2}$, $-\sqrt{2}$, $-0.415$, $-0.62$, $-4.120345061\ldots$ are negative numbers.

% Defining non-negative numbers
\textbf{Non-negative Number:} All positive numbers, including 0, are non-negative numbers. For example, $0$, $3$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $0.612$, $1.3$, $2.120345\ldots$ are non-negative numbers.



\part{Irrational Numbers and Proofs}
\section*{Examples and Properties}

% Example 1: Finding irrational numbers
\textbf{Example 1.} Find an irrational number between $\sqrt{3}$ and 4.

\textbf{Solution:} Here, $\sqrt{3} = 1.7320508\ldots$. Suppose $a$ and $b$ are two irrational numbers between $\sqrt{3}$ and 4, where $a = \sqrt{3} + 1$ and $b = \sqrt{3} + 2$. Obviously, $a$ and $b$ are irrational numbers and lie between $\sqrt{3}$ and 4, that is:
\[
\sqrt{3} < \sqrt{3} + 1 < \sqrt{3} + 2 < 4
\]
Therefore, $a$ and $b$ are the desired irrational numbers. In fact, countless such irrational numbers can be constructed.

% Basic characteristics of real number operations
\textbf{Basic Characteristics of Addition and Multiplication of Real Numbers:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, (i) $a + b$ is a real number, and (ii) $ab$ is a real number.
    \item If $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, (i) $a + b = b + a$, and (ii) $ab = ba$.
    \item If $a$, $b$, $c$ are real numbers, (i) $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$, and (ii) $(ab)c = a(bc)$.
    \item If $a$ is a real number, there are only two real numbers 0 and 1 such that (i) $0 \neq 1$, (ii) $a + 0 = 0 + a = a$, and (iii) $a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a$.
    \item If $a$ is a real number, (i) $a + (-a) = 0$, (ii) if $a \neq 0$, then $a \cdot \frac{1}{a} = 1$.
    \item If $a$, $b$, $c$ are real numbers, $a(b + c) = ab + ac$.
    \item If $a$, $b$ are real numbers, $a < b$ or $a = b$ or $a > b$.
    \item If $a$, $b$, $c$ are real numbers and $a < b$, then $a + c < b + c$.
    \item If $a$, $b$, $c$ are real numbers and $a < b$, then (i) $ac < bc$ whenever $c > 0$, (ii) $ac > bc$ whenever $c < 0$.
\end{enumerate}

% Proposition: Proving sqrt(2) is irrational
\textbf{Proposition:} $\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number.

\textbf{Proof:} Suppose $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then there exist two mutually prime numbers $p, q > 1$ such that $\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}$. Squaring both sides:
\[
2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2} \quad \text{or} \quad 2q = \frac{p^2}{q}
\]
Multiplying both sides by $q$, $2q$ is an integer, but $\frac{p^2}{q}$ is not an integer, since $p$ and $q$ are natural numbers, mutually prime, and $q > 1$. Thus, $2q \neq \frac{p^2}{q}$, so $\sqrt{2} \neq \frac{p}{q}$. Therefore, $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. $\square$



% Example 2: Proving a property of consecutive numbers
\textbf{Example 2.} Prove that when one is added to the product of 4 consecutive natural numbers, it becomes a perfect square.

\textbf{Solution:} Let the consecutive integers be $x$, $x+1$, $x+2$, $x+3$. Adding 1 to their product:
\[
\begin{aligned}
& x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) + 1 \\
&= x(x+3)(x+1)(x+2) + 1 \\
&= (x^2 + 3x)(x^2 + 3x + 2) + 1 \\
&= a(a + 2) + 1 \quad [\text{Assume } x^2 + 3x = a] \\
&= a^2 + 2a + 1 = (a + 1)^2 = (x^2 + 3x + 1)^2
\end{aligned}
\]
This is a perfect square. Therefore, when 1 is added to the product of any four consecutive natural numbers, it becomes a perfect square.

\part{Decimal Fractions}
\section*{Decimal Fractions}

% Classifying decimal fractions
Each real number can be expressed as a decimal fraction. For example, $2 = 2.0$, $\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$, $\frac{1}{3} = 0.333\ldots$. Decimal fractions are of three types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Finite Decimal Fractions:} Have a finite number of digits after the decimal point, e.g., $0.12$, $1.023$, $7.832$, $54.67$.
    \item \textbf{Repeated Decimal Fractions:} Some or all digits to the right of the decimal point repeat, e.g., $3.333\ldots$, $2.454545\ldots$, $5.12765765\ldots$.
    \item \textbf{Infinite Decimal Fractions:} Digits to the right of the decimal point never terminate and do not repeat, e.g., $1.4142135\ldots$, $2.8284271\ldots$.
\end{itemize}

% Remarks on decimal fractions
\textbf{Remarks:} Finite and repeating decimal fractions are rational numbers, whereas infinite decimal fractions are irrational numbers. The value of any irrational number can be determined up to any desired decimal place. If the numerator and denominator of a fraction can be represented by natural numbers, the fraction is rational.



\subsection*{Repeating Decimal Fractions}

% Explaining repeating decimal fractions
A decimal fraction where the same digit or set of digits appears repeatedly after the decimal point is a repeating decimal fraction. The repeating part is called the repetend, and the remaining part is non-repeating. If a single digit repeats, a dot is placed above it; otherwise, dots are placed above the first and last repeating digits. For example, $2.555\ldots$ is written as $2.\dot{5}$, and $3.124124124\ldots$ as $3.\dot{1}2\dot{4}$.

% Defining pure and mixed repeating fractions
If every digit after the decimal point is repeating, it is a pure repeating fraction; otherwise, it is a mixed repeating fraction. For example, $1.\dot{3}$ is a pure repeating fraction, and $4.235\dot{1}1\dot{2}$ is a mixed repeating fraction.

% Properties of repeating decimal fractions
If the denominator has factors other than 2 or 5, no numerator will be divisible by that denominator. Since remainders are digits from 1 to 9, the same numbers will appear. The number of digits in the repeating part is always less than the number in the denominator.

% Example 3: Converting fractions to decimal fractions
\textbf{Example 3.} Express $\frac{3}{11}$ and $\frac{95}{37}$ into decimal fractions.

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{For } \frac{3}{11}: \\
&\begin{array}{r}
11 \mid 30.0 \\
\cline{2-2}
22 \\
\hline
80 \\
77 \\
\hline
30 \\
22 \\
\hline
80 \\
77 \\
\hline
3 \\
\end{array}
\quad \therefore \frac{3}{11} = 0.2727\ldots = 0.\dot{2}\dot{7} \\
&\text{For } \frac{95}{37}: \\
&\begin{array}{r}
37 \mid 95.0 \\
\cline{2-2}
74 \\
\hline
210 \\
185 \\
\hline
250 \\
222 \\
\hline
280 \\
259 \\
\hline
210 \\
185 \\
\hline
250 \\
222 \\
\hline
280 \\
259 \\
\hline
21 \\
\end{array}
\quad \therefore \frac{95}{37} = 2.567567\ldots = 2.\dot{5}\dot{6}7
\end{aligned}
\]
Desired decimal fractions are $0.\dot{2}\dot{7}$ and $2.\dot{5}\dot{6}7$.

\subsection*{Converting Repeating Decimal Fractions into Common Fractions}

% Example 4: Converting repeating decimals to fractions
\textbf{Example 4.} Convert $0.\dot{3}$, $0.\dot{2}\dot{4}$, and $42.34\dot{7}\dot{8}$ into common fractions.

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{For } 0.\dot{3} = 0.3333\ldots: \\
&0.\dot{3} \times 10 = 3.333\ldots, \quad 0.\dot{3} \times 1 = 0.333\ldots \\
&\text{Subtracting: } 0.\dot{3} \times (10 - 1) = 3.333\ldots - 0.333\ldots = 3 \\
&0.\dot{3} \times 9 = 3 \quad \therefore 0.\dot{3} = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} \\
&\text{For } 0.\dot{2}\dot{4} = 0.242424\ldots: \\
&0.\dot{2}\dot{4} \times 100 = 24.2424\ldots, \quad 0.\dot{2}\dot{4} \times 1 = 0.2424\ldots \\
&\text{Subtracting: } 0.\dot{2}\dot{4} \times (100 - 1) = 24.2424\ldots - 0.2424\ldots = 24 \\
&0.\dot{2}\dot{4} \times 99 = 24 \quad \therefore 0.\dot{2}\dot{4} = \frac{24}{99} = \frac{8}{33} \\
&\text{For } 42.34\dot{7}\dot{8} = 42.347878\ldots: \\
&42.34\dot{7}\dot{8} \times 10000 = 423478.7878\ldots, \quad 42.34\dot{7}\dot{8} \times 100 = 4234.7878\ldots \\
&\text{Subtracting: } 42.34\dot{7}\dot{8} \times (10000 - 100) = 423478.7878\ldots - 4234.7878\ldots = 419244 \\
&42.34\dot{7}\dot{8} \times 9900 = 419244 \quad \therefore 42.34\dot{7}\dot{8} = \frac{419244}{9900} = \frac{34937}{825} = 42 \frac{287}{825}
\end{aligned}
\]
Desired common fractions are $0.\dot{3} = \frac{1}{3}$, $0.\dot{2}\dot{4} = \frac{8}{33}$, $42.34\dot{7}\dot{8} = 42 \frac{287}{825}$.

% Explanation of the conversion process
\textbf{Explanation:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiply the repeating fraction by $10^n$, where $n$ is the number of digits in the repeating part.
    \item Multiply by $10^m$, where $m$ is the number of non-repeating digits after the decimal point.
    \item Subtract the second result from the first to eliminate the repeating part, yielding a whole number.
    \item Divide by $10^n - 10^m$, which is a number with as many 9s as repeating digits and as many 0s as non-repeating digits.
\end{itemize}

% Remarks on repeating decimal fractions
\textbf{Remarks:} Repeating decimal fractions can always be converted into common fractions and are rational numbers.

% Example 5: Converting a repeating decimal to a fraction
\textbf{Example 5.} Convert $5.234\dot{5}\dot{7}$ into a common fraction.

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
\begin{aligned}
5.234\dot{5}\dot{7} &= 5.23457457\ldots \\
5.234\dot{5}\dot{7} \times 100000 &= 523457.457457\ldots \\
5.234\dot{5}\dot{7} \times 100 &= 523.457457\ldots \\
\text{Subtracting: } 5.234\dot{5}\dot{7} \times (100000 - 100) &= 523457.457457\ldots - 523.457457\ldots = 522934 \\
5.234\dot{5}\dot{7} \times 99900 &= 522934 \quad \therefore 5.234\dot{5}\dot{7} = \frac{522934}{99900} = \frac{261467}{49950} = 5 \frac{11717}{49950}
\end{aligned}
\]
The required fraction is $5 \frac{11717}{49950}$.

% Rules for converting repeating decimals to fractions
\textbf{Rules for Converting Repeating Decimal Fractions into Common Fractions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Numerator:} Subtract the integer formed by the non-repeating portion from the integer obtained by deleting the decimal point.
    \item \textbf{Denominator:} Form a number with as many 9s as digits in the repeating part, followed by as many 0s as digits in the non-repeating part after the decimal point.
\end{itemize}

% Example 6: Converting a repeating decimal to a fraction
\textbf{Example 6.} Convert $45.23\dot{4}\dot{6}$ into a common fraction.

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
45.23\dot{4}\dot{6} = \frac{452346 - 452}{9990} = \frac{451894}{9990} = \frac{225947}{4995} = 45 \frac{1172}{4995}
\]
The desired fraction is $45 \frac{1172}{4995}$.

% Example 7: Converting a repeating decimal to a fraction
\textbf{Example 7.} Convert $32.\dot{5}\dot{6}7$ into a common fraction.

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
32.\dot{5}\dot{6}7 = \frac{32567 - 32}{999} = \frac{32535}{999} = \frac{3615}{111} = \frac{1205}{37} = 32 \frac{21}{37}
\]
The desired fraction is $32 \frac{21}{37}$.



\subsection*{Similar and Dissimilar Repeating Decimal Fractions}

% Defining similar and dissimilar repeating decimals
If two or more repeating decimal fractions have the same number of digits in both repeating and non-repeating parts, they are similar repeating decimal fractions; otherwise, they are dissimilar. For example, $12.\dot{4}\dot{5}$ and $6.\dot{3}\dot{2}$, $9.\dot{4}\dot{5}3$ and $125.\dot{8}\dot{9}7$ are similar, but $0.\dot{3}\dot{4}56$ and $7.\dot{4}\dot{5}789$, $6.\dot{4}\dot{3}57$ and $2.\dot{8}\dot{9}345$ are dissimilar.

% Converting dissimilar to similar repeating decimals
To convert dissimilar repeating decimal fractions into similar ones, ensure each has an equal number of non-repeating digits, and the repeating part has a number of digits equal to the lowest common multiple (LCM) of the digits in all repeating parts.

% Example 8: Converting to similar repeating decimals
\textbf{Example 8.} Convert $5.\dot{6}$, $7.\dot{3}\dot{4}5$, and $10.78\dot{4}2\dot{3}$ into similar repeating decimal fractions.

\textbf{Solution:} The numbers have 0, 1, and 2 non-repeating digits, respectively, and 1, 2, and 3 repeating digits. The LCM of 1, 2, and 3 is 6. To make them similar, each must have 2 non-repeating digits and 6 repeating digits:
\[
5.\dot{6} = 5.66666666, \quad 7.\dot{3}\dot{4}5 = 7.34545454, \quad 10.78\dot{4}2\dot{3} = 10.78423423
\]
Desired similar repeating decimal fractions are $5.66666666$, $7.34545454$, and $10.78423423$.

% Example 9: Converting to similar repeating decimals
\textbf{Example 9.} Convert $1.7643$, $3.\dot{2}\dot{4}$, and $2.78\dot{3}\dot{4}6$ into similar repeating decimal fractions.

\textbf{Solution:} The numbers have 4, 0, and 2 non-repeating digits, and 0, 2, and 3 repeating digits. The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. Each must have 4 non-repeating digits and 6 repeating digits:
\[
1.7643 = 1.7643000000, \quad 3.\dot{2}\dot{4} = 3.2424242424, \quad 2.78\dot{3}\dot{4}6 = 2.783BRE4634
\]
Desired similar repeating decimal fractions are $1.7643000000$, $3.2424242424$, and $2.7834634634$.

% Remarks on converting to similar decimals
\textbf{Remarks:} To convert finite decimal fractions into similar decimal fractions, add sufficient zeros to match the number of non-repeating digits. For repeating decimal fractions, ensure equal numbers of non-repeating and repeating digits.



\part{Operations on Repeating Decimal Fractions}
\subsection*{Addition and Subtraction of Repeating Decimal Fractions}

% Explaining addition and subtraction
To add or subtract repeating decimal fractions, convert them into similar repeating decimals, then perform addition or subtraction as with finite decimal fractions. For mixed finite and repeating decimals, ensure the non-repeating part of repeating fractions matches the number of digits after the decimal point in finite fractions, with repeating parts equal to the LCM of repeating digits. Add zeros to finite decimals as needed. If a carry-over occurs in addition, add it to the sum; in subtraction, subtract it from the difference.

% Remarks on the results
\textbf{Remarks:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The sum or difference of repeating decimals is also a repeating decimal fraction. The non-repeating part has digits equal to the highest number of non-repeating digits, and the repeating part has digits equal to the LCM of the repeating parts. For finite decimals, the non-repeating part matches the highest number of digits after the decimal point.
    \item Converting to common fractions and performing operations is possible but time-consuming.
\end{enumerate}

% Example 10: Adding repeating decimals
\textbf{Example 10.} Add $3.\dot{8}\dot{9}$, $2.1\dot{7}\dot{8}$, and $5.89\dot{7}\dot{9}8$.

\textbf{Solution:} The numbers have 2 non-repeating digits, and repeating parts have 2, 2, and 3 digits, with LCM 6. Convert to similar repeating decimals:
\[
\begin{aligned}
3.\dot{8}\dot{9} &= 3.89898989 \\
2.1\dot{7}\dot{8} &= 2.17878787 \\
5.89\dot{7}\dot{9}8 &= 5.89798798 \\
\hline
& 11.97576574 \quad [8+8+7+2=25, \text{ carry } 2] \\
& + 2 \\
\hline
& 11.97576576
\end{aligned}
\]
The desired result is $11.97\dot{5}7\dot{6}$.

% Alternative explanation
\textbf{N W
ote:} Alternatively:
\[
\begin{aligned}
3.\dot{8}\dot{9} &= 3.89898989 \mid 89 \\
2.1\dot{7}\dot{8} &= 2.17878787 \mid 87 \\
5.89\dot{7}\dot{9}8 &= 5.89798798 \mid 79 \\
\hline
& 11.97576574 \mid 55 \\
\end{aligned}
\]
The carry-over 2 is added to the digits before the vertical line, yielding the same sum.

% Example 11: Adding mixed decimals
\textbf{Example 11.} Add $8.947\dot{8}$, $2.346$, and $4.\dot{7}\dot{1}$.

\textbf{Solution:} Ensure 3 non-repeating digits and 6 repeating digits (LCM of 2 and 3):
\[
\begin{aligned}
8.947\dot{8} &= 8.947847847 \\
2.346 &= 2.346000000 \\
4.\dot{7}\dot{1} &= 4.717171717 \\
\hline
& 16.011019564 \quad [8+0+1+1=10, \text{ carry } 1] \\
& + 1 \\
\hline
& 16.011019565
\end{aligned}
\]
The desired sum is $16.01101956\dot{5}$.



% Example 12: Subtracting repeating decimals
\textbf{Example 12.} Subtract $5.24\dot{6}\dot{7}3$ from $8.24\dot{3}$.

\textbf{Solution:} Ensure 2 non-repeating digits and 6 repeating digits (LCM of 2 and 3):

\subsection*{Multiplication and Division of Repeating Decimal Fractions}

% Explaining multiplication and division
Convert repeating decimal fractions into common fractions, perform multiplication or division, and convert the result back to a decimal fraction. For division with both dividend and divisor as repeating decimals, convert to similar repeating decimals to simplify operations.

% Example 14: Multiplying repeating decimals
\textbf{Example 14.} Multiply $4.\dot{3}$ with $5.\dot{7}$.

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
\begin{aligned}
4.\dot{3} &= \frac{43 - 4}{9} = \frac{39}{9} = \frac{13}{3} \\
5.\dot{7} &= \frac{57 - 5}{9} = \frac{52}{9} \\
4.\dot{3} \times 5.\dot{7} &= \frac{13}{3} \times \frac{52}{9} = \frac{676}{27} = 25.0\dot{3}7
\end{aligned}
\]
The desired result is $25.0\dot{3}7$.

% Example 15: Multiplying repeating decimals
\textbf{Example 15.} Multiply $0.\dot{2}8$ with $42.1\dot{8}$.

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
\begin{aligned}
0.\dot{2}8 &= \frac{28 - 2}{90} = \frac{26}{90} = \frac{13}{45} \\
42.1\dot{8} &= \frac{4218 - 42}{99} = \frac{4176}{99} = \frac{464}{11} \\
0.\dot{2}8 \times 42.1\dot{8} &= \frac{13}{45} \times \frac{464}{11} = \frac{6032}{495} = 12.185
\end{aligned}
\]
The desired result is $12.185$.

% Example 16: Multiplying multiple decimals
\textbf{Example 16.} How much is $2.\dot{5} \times 4.\dot{3}5 \times 1.23\dot{4}$?

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
\begin{aligned}
2.\dot{5} &= \frac{25}{10} = \frac{5}{2} \\
4.\dot{3}5 &= \frac{435 - 43}{90} = \frac{392}{90} \\
1.23\dot{4} &= \frac{1234 - 12}{990} = \frac{1222}{990} = \frac{611}{495} \\
2.\dot{5} \times 4.\dot{3}5 \times 1.23\dot{4} &= \frac{5}{2} \times \frac{392}{90} \times \frac{611}{495} = \frac{119756}{8910} = 13.440628\ldots
\end{aligned}
\]
The desired result is $13.440628$ (approx.).



% Example 17: Dividing repeating decimals
\textbf{Example 17.} Divide $7.\dot{3}2$ by $0.\dot{2}7$.

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
\begin{aligned}
7.\dot{3}2 &= \frac{732 - 7}{99} = \frac{725 Although}{99} \\
0.\dot{2}7 &= \frac{27 - 2}{90} = \frac{25}{90} = \frac{5}{18} \\
7.\dot{3}2 \div 0.\dot{2}7 &= \frac{725}{99} \div \frac{5}{18} = \frac{725}{99} \times \frac{18}{5} = \frac{290}{11} = 26.\dot{3}6
\end{aligned}
\]
The desired result is $26.\dot{3}6$.

% Example 18: Dividing repeating decimals
\textbf{Example 18.} Divide $2.\dot{2}71\dot{8}$ by $1.91\dot{2}$.

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
\begin{aligned}
2.\dot{2}71\dot{8} &= \frac{22718 - 2}{9999} = \frac{22716}{9999} \\
1.91\dot{2} &= \frac{1912 - 19}{990} = \frac{1893}{990} \\
2.\dot{2}71\dot{8} \div 1.91\dot{2} &= \frac{22716}{9999} \div \frac{1893}{990} = \frac{22716}{9999} \times \frac{990}{1893} = \frac{120}{101} = 1.1881
\end{aligned}
\]
The desired result is $1.1881$.

% Example 19: Dividing repeating decimals
\textbf{Example 19.} Divide $9.\dot{4}5$ by $2.8\dot{6}3$.

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
\begin{aligned}
9.\dot{4}5 &= \frac{945}{100} \\
2.8\dot{6}3 &= \frac{2863 - 28}{990} = \frac{2835}{990} \\
9.\dot{4}5 \div 2.8\dot{6}3 &= \frac{945}{100} \div \frac{2835}{990} = \frac{945}{100} \times \frac{990}{2835} = \frac{189 \times 99}{2 \times 2835} = \frac{33}{10} = 3.3
\end{aligned}
\]
The desired result is $3.3$.

\subsection*{Infinite Decimal Fractions}

% Explaining infinite decimal fractions
Decimal numbers with infinitely many non-repeating digits after the decimal point are infinite decimal fractions. For example, $5.134248513942301\ldots$ and $\sqrt{2} = 1.4142135\ldots$ are infinite decimal fractions.

% Example calculation of sqrt(2)
\[
\begin{array}{r}
1 \mid 2 (1.4142135\ldots \\
\cline{2-2}

\part{Approximation of Real Numbers}
\section*{Value and Approximate Values}

% Explaining value vs. approximation
Calculating an infinite decimal fraction up to a certain number of decimal places differs from approximating it. For example, $5.4325893\ldots$ calculated to 4 decimal places is $5.4325$, but approximated to 4 decimal places is $5.4326$. For approximation, if the next digit is 5 or more, add 1 to the last position; otherwise, keep it unchanged.

% Example 20: Calculating sqrt(13)
\textbf{Example 20.} Find the square root of 13 and its approximate value up to 3 decimal places.

\textbf{Solution:}
\[
\begin{array}{r}
3 \mid 13 (3.605551\ldots \\
\cline{2-2}
9 \\
\hline
66 \mid 400 \\
396 \\
\hline
7205 \mid 40000 \\
36025 \\
\hline
72105 \mid 397500 \\
360525 \\
\hline
721105 \mid 3697500 \\
3605525 \\
\hline
9197500 \\
\end{array}
\]
The square root is $3.605551\ldots$, and the approximate value to 3 decimal places is $3.606$.

% Example 21: Calculating values and approximations
\textbf{Example 21.} Calculate values and approximate values of $4.4623845\ldots$ up to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 decimal places.

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 decimal place: Value = $4.4$, Approximate = $4.5$
    \item 2 decimal places: Value = $4.46$, Approximate = $4.46$
    \item 3 decimal places: Value = $4.462$, Approximate = $4.462$
    \item 4 decimal places: Value = $4.4623$, Approximate = $4.4624$
    \item 5 decimal places: Value = $4.46238$, Approximate = $4.46238$
