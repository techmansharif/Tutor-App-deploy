Okay! We've learned about all kinds of nouns, from your *own special name* (proper noun) to things you can't even *see* (abstract noun)! Now, it's time to become a noun *detective* with **Activity 4**!

**Step 1: The Noun Mission!**

We're going to read a story about Hasan, the farmer. Our mission is to find all the nouns in the story. Remember, nouns are names for *people, places, things, and ideas*.

**Step 2: Detective Tools Ready!**

As you read, think about what kind of noun each one is:

*   **Proper Noun:** A special name, like "Hasan" or "Sirajganj." Start with a capital letter!
*   **Common Noun:** A general name, like "farmer" or "village."
*   **Collective Noun:** A name for a group, like "herd."
*   **Material Noun:** A name for something you can't easily count, like "rice" or "milk."
*   **Abstract Noun:** A name for something you can't see or touch, like "love" or "sympathy."

**Step 3: The Story of Hasan!**

Here's the story:

"Hasan is a rich farmer who lives in a village in the district of Sirajganj. He has a lot of cultivable land. He grows rice, wheat, and other crops. He has a herd of cattle and other domestic animals. They provide him with milk and meat. Hasan is a kind man. He has love and sympathy for the poor class of people."

**Step 4: Clue by Clue! (Examples)**

Let's start with the first sentence:

*   "Hasan": This is the *special* name of a person. So, it's a **Proper Noun**!
*   "farmer": This is a *general* name for someone who grows food. So, it's a **Common Noun**!
*   "village": This is a *general* name for a place. So, it's a **Common Noun**!
*   "Sirajganj": This is the *special* name of a district (like a big town). So, it's a **Proper Noun**!

**Step 5: You're the Detective Now!**

Now it's your turn! Go through the rest of the story and find all the nouns. Write down each noun and say what kind it is (Proper, Common, Collective, Material, or Abstract). You can ask for help anytime.

For example:

*Land: Common Noun
*Rice: Material Noun
*Wheat: Material Noun
*Herd: Collective Noun
*Milk: Material Noun
*Meat: Material Noun
*Cattle: Collective Noun
*People: Common Noun
*Love: Abstract Noun
*Sympathy: Abstract Noun

**In Simple Words:**

Read the story about Hasan. Find all the names in the story. Then, tell me if each name is a special name (Proper), a general name (Common), a group name (Collective), a "stuff" name (Material), or a "feeling" name (Abstract). You're a noun detective!
