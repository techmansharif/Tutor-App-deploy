Okay! We're still talking about those comparing words, like we did with "taller" and "faster"!

The text tells us a special rule for *short* describing words that only have *one sound* (one syllable).

**Step 1: What is a Syllable?**

Imagine clapping when you say a word. "Tall" is one clap. "Taller" is two claps. "Tall" has one syllable. "Taller" has two.

**Step 2: Short words get "-er"!**

The text says if the word is short (one syllable), we usually just add "-er" to compare.

**Step 3: Let's use the example!**

The text gives us "mild" changing to "milder."

*   **Mild (gentle):** Think of a mild taste, not strong.
*   **Milder (more gentle):** The sun is milder today than yesterday.

So, "mild" is describing something that isn't strong, and "milder" is saying one thing is *more* gentle than another. We just added "-er"!

**Step 4: Ali and Abu are back!**

Let's say Ali has a **loud** voice. Abu has an even **louder** voice! We added "-er" to "loud" to make "louder"! "Louder" compares Ali's and Abu's voices. Abu's voice is more loud than Ali's voice.

**In short:** If a describing word is short (one syllable), just add "-er" to compare it!
