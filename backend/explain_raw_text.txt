Okay, let's make this text about common nouns fun and easy! We already know about nouns (words for things) and even proper nouns (special names). Now we'll learn about common nouns (general names)!

**1. Nasima the Girl**

The text starts with "Nasima is a beautiful girl." Remember "Nasima" would be a Proper Noun (special name) because that's HER name. But it uses "girl." "Girl" is a common noun because it could be ANY girl.

**2. What are Common Nouns?**

The text says common nouns are for "every person, place, or thing of the same class or kind." This means it's not a specific name. Think of it like this: "dog" is a common noun because it could be ANY dog. "Spot" is a proper noun because it's *that specific dog's* name.

**3. Not Special**

The text says common nouns "do not refer to anything in particular (special)." That means they are general. Like saying "city" instead of "London."

**4. One or Many (Singular and Plural)**

The text says common nouns can be "singular (one)" or "plural (more than one)." Like "city" is one, and "cities" is many.

**5. Shakespeare Again!**

Remember Shakespeare from before? The text gives examples how the proper noun "Shakespeare" can be used as a common noun.

**The story of the "Shakespeare":** He's called "The Shakespeare of Bangladesh" because he's the *best writer* there, just like the Famous Shakespeare. "Shakespeare" becomes a *general term* or the person who is the best, not the special person named Shakespeare.

**6. The Story of Raghib:** There are two "Raghibs" in class. Now Raghib is the special name.

It means that both the child has the same name and can also be used to address him as "boys named Raghib"
