Okay! Let's learn about "first conditional sentences" in a fun and easy way!

Since we haven't talked before, I'll start from the very beginning. Imagine you're planning a super fun day!

**Think of it like a "What if?" game:**

First conditional sentences are like saying "What if... then this will happen!"  They talk about things that *could* happen in the future.

**Here's a simple example:**

Let's say you see this sentence:  "If it rains, I will bring my umbrella."

*   **If it rains:** This is the "What if?" part. It's the *condition* or the *possibility.*
    *   "rains" means water falls from the sky.
*   **I will bring my umbrella:** This is what *will* happen *if* it rains. It's the *result.*
    *   "umbrella" is something you use to keep yourself dry in the rain.

**The sentence means:** *If* rain starts to fall (the condition), *then* I will get my umbrella to stay dry (the result).

**Think of it like a mini-story:**

Imagine you want to go to the park. But there's a chance of rain!

You think: "Hmm... **If it rains**, I **will stay home** and read a book."

See? You're using a first conditional sentence! You are talking about something that *might* happen (rain) and what you *will* do *if* it happens (stay home).

**So, first conditional sentences are all about:**

*   **A *possible* thing happening in the future (the "if" part).**
*   **The *result* of that thing happening (the "then" part - what *will* happen).**
