Okay! Let's learn about "first conditional" sentences. Think of it like making a plan for something that *might* happen. We're going to look at some examples to make it super easy.

Imagine this: You are planning to go to the park. But! You will only go if the sun is shining.

Here's how we can say that in a "first conditional" sentence:

**If** the sun shines, **then** I will go to the park.

See how it works?

*   **"If"** tells us the condition (the thing that *needs* to happen). The sun shining is the condition.
*   **"Then"** tells us what will happen *if* the condition is true. Going to the park will happen.

Let's try another one:

**If** I study hard, **then** I will pass the test.

*   The condition: Studying hard.
*   What will happen *if* I study hard: Passing the test.

So, "first conditional" sentences are just ways of saying, "If this happens, then that will happen." It's like a mini-promise you're making to yourself (or someone else!). We are talking about the future.

Do you want to try making your own example? Or should we look at a few more examples first?
