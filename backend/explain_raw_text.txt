Okay! You want me to explain the "Gender" text in a fun way, right? Let's do it! Remember how we talked about superheroes?

**What the Text Says About Gender:**

The text talks about "gender" in a different way than we did before. This time, it's talking about words!

**Step 1: Words Have Genders!**

Imagine words are like tiny people! Some are "boy words" (male), some are "girl words" (female).

**Step 2: Finding the "Boy" and "Girl" Words**

The text wants us to find the "boy" and "girl" words in the story:

*   **Teachers:** Could be boys or girls! (Both)
*   **Spouses:** Could be boys or girls! (Both)
*   **Children:** Could be boys or girls! (Both)
*   **Mr. Rahman:** A boy word! (Male)
*   **Wife:** A girl word! (Female)
*   **Son:** A boy word! (Male)
*   **Daughter:** A girl word! (Female)

**Step 3: It's Like a Word Detective Game!**

The text is like a word detective game! You need to look at the words and decide if they are about a boy, a girl, or both!

**Why is this important?**

Sometimes, in language, we need to know if we are talking about a boy or a girl to use the correct words. It's like knowing which superhero to call!
