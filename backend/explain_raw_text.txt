Okay, let's make the sentence "**abroad** soon. (*abroad* modifies *is going*, *soon* modifies *is going*)" easy and fun! Remember, we talked about adverbs as tiny helpers for words.

**Step 1: The Sentence**

The sentence is like saying, "Someone is going abroad soon."

**Step 2: What does it mean**
* going abroad = is going to another country
* soon = in short time
**Step 3: Finding the Adverbs**

*   We have "**is going**". "Is going" is the action. It means someone is traveling.
*   Then we have "**abroad**". "Abroad" is like saying "to another country". It tells us *where* they are going. "Abroad" modifies (give more information) "is going".
*   We also have "**soon**". "Soon" means it will happen in a short time. It tells us *when* they are going. "Soon" modifies (give more information) "is going".

**Step 4: Story Time!**

Imagine a little bear named Barnaby. Barnaby is packing his tiny suitcase. He is going **abroad** **soon**!

*   **Abroad** tells us Barnaby is going to a different country! Maybe he is going to France!
*   **Soon** tells us he is leaving *very quickly*! Maybe tomorrow!

So, "Barnaby is going **abroad** **soon**" means Barnaby will travel to another country in a short time. The words "abroad" and "soon" gives additional information about his travel.
