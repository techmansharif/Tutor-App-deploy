Okay! Let's explain geometric proportions in a fun way. Remember our recipe idea from before? We'll use that again!

Imagine triangles are like slices of pizza.

**1. Equal Heights (Same Height Pizza)**

*   Think of two pizza slices. They are cut from pizzas that are the same height. That means the height of each slice is the same.

*   The rule says: The bigger the base (crust length), the bigger the slice! The **area** (size of the slice) is **proportional** (related) to the base.

*   **Area of** means how big the pizza slice is. **Proportional** means they change together. If the base doubles, the slice doubles!

*   **Example**: Let's say pizza slice $ABC$ has a base of 2 inches and pizza slice $DEF$ has a base of 4 inches. Slice $DEF$ is twice as big!

    *   $$ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC : \text{Area of } \triangle DEF = BC : EF $$

**2. Equal Bases (Same Crust Pizza)**

*   Now, imagine two pizza slices that have the same crust length.

*   The rule says: The taller the slice (height), the bigger it is! The area (size of the slice) is proportional to the height.

*   **Example**: Imagine that the height of Pizza $ABC$ is 3 inches and the height of Pizza $DEF$ is 6 inches. Then pizza $DEF$ is twice as big.

    *   $$ \text{Area of } \triangle ABC : \text{Area of } \triangle DEF = AP : DQ $$

So, if pizzas have the same height, the bigger the base, the bigger the slice. If they have the same base, the taller the pizza, the bigger the slice!
